## What is a Data Broker?

A data broker (also called an information broker or data vendor) is a company that collects personal information about individuals and sells it to other businesses or individuals. These companies operate largely in the shadows, gathering data from hundreds of sources without most people's knowledge or consent.

## The Data Broker Industry by the Numbers

- **4,000+** data broker companies operate in the US alone
- **$200+ billion** annual industry revenue
- **Average person** has their data on 50+ data broker sites (we scan 2,100+)
- **1,500+ data points** collected per person on average

## How Data Brokers Collect Your Information

### Public Records
- Voter registration
- Property records
- Court records
- Marriage and divorce records
- Birth and death records
- Business filings

### Online Activity
- Social media profiles
- Website cookies and tracking
- Online purchases
- Search history
- App usage data

Employers, landlords, and insurers may use data broker information to discriminate.

## Introduction to Privacy Laws

Privacy laws give you control over your personal data. The two most significant are:

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) - European Union
- **CCPA/CPRA** (California Consumer Privacy Act) - California, USA

Understanding these laws is essential for protecting your privacy in the digital age.

## GDPR Overview

The GDPR, enacted in 2018, is the world's strongest privacy law. It applies to any company processing data of EU residents, regardless of where the company is located.

### GDPR Key Rights

1. **Right of Access** - Know what data companies have about you
2. **Right to Rectification** - Correct inaccurate data
3. **Right to Erasure** - Request deletion ("right to be forgotten")
4. **Right to Restrict Processing** - Limit how your data is used
5. **Right to Data Portability** - Get your data in a usable format
6. **Right to Object** - Opt out of certain processing
7. **Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making** - Human review of AI decisions

### GDPR Penalties

Companies can be fined up to:
- €20 million, or
- 4% of global annual revenue (whichever is higher)

## CCPA/CPRA Overview

The CCPA (2020) and its amendment CPRA (2023) give California residents significant privacy rights. Many US states are adopting similar laws.

### CCPA Key Rights

1. **Right to Know** - What data is collected and how it's used
2. **Right to Delete** - Request deletion of your data
3. **Right to Opt-Out** - Stop the sale of your personal information
4. **Right to Non-Discrimination** - Companies can't penalize you for exercising rights
5. **Right to Correct** - Fix inaccurate information (added by CPRA)
6. **Right to Limit** - Restrict use of sensitive personal information (CPRA)

### CCPA Penalties

- $2,500 per unintentional violation
- $7,500 per intentional violation
- Private right of action for data breaches

## CCPA vs GDPR: Key Differences

| Aspect | GDPR | CCPA |
|--------|------|------|
| **Scope** | EU residents | California residents |
| **Opt-in vs Opt-out** | Requires opt-in consent | Allows opt-out of sales |
| **Data Covered** | All personal data | Excludes some employee/B2B data |
| **Enforcement** | Data Protection Authorities | California AG + private lawsuits |
| **Penalties** | Up to 4% global revenue | $2,500-$7,500 per violation |

## How to Exercise Your Rights

### Under GDPR
1. Find the company's Data Protection Officer (DPO) contact
2. Submit a "Subject Access Request" or deletion request
3. Company must respond within 30 days
4. Free of charge (usually)

### Under CCPA
1. Look for "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link
2. Submit opt-out or deletion request
3. Company must respond within 45 days
4. May need to verify your identity

## Using Privacy Laws Against Data Brokers

Data brokers are required to comply with CCPA and GDPR. You can:

1. **Request your data** - See what they have on you
2. **Request deletion** - Remove your information
3. **Opt out of sales** - Stop them from selling your data
4. **File complaints** - Report non-compliance to authorities

## GhostMyData Does the Heavy Lifting

Manually exercising your rights with hundreds of data brokers is impractical. GhostMyData:

- Submits CCPA/GDPR requests automatically
- Tracks response times and compliance
- Re-submits when companies don't comply
- Documents everything for potential complaints

## What is the Dark Web?

The dark web is a hidden part of the internet that requires special software (like Tor) to access. While it has legitimate uses, it's also where criminals buy, sell, and trade:

- Stolen personal information
- Login credentials
- Credit card numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Medical records
- Corporate data

## How Your Data Ends Up on the Dark Web

### Data Breaches
When companies are hacked, stolen databases are often sold on dark web marketplaces.

### Phishing Attacks
Criminals trick people into revealing credentials, then sell them in bulk.

### Malware
Keyloggers and info-stealers harvest data from infected computers.

### Data Broker Leaks
Even data brokers get breached, exposing aggregated personal information.

### Insider Threats
Employees sometimes steal and sell customer data.

## What's Sold on the Dark Web

| Data Type | Typical Price |
|-----------|---------------|
| Email + Password | $1-10 |
| Credit Card | $5-20 |
| Full Identity (SSN, DOB, etc.) | $15-100 |
| Bank Account Login | $50-200 |
| Medical Records | $100-1,000 |
| Passport Scans | $100-500 |

## What is Dark Web Monitoring?

Dark web monitoring services scan dark web marketplaces, forums, and paste sites to detect when your personal information appears. When your data is found, you're alerted so you can take action.

### What Gets Monitored

- Email addresses
- Passwords (hashed)
- Social Security Numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Bank account numbers
- Phone numbers
- Passport numbers
- Medical ID numbers

## How Dark Web Monitoring Works

1. **Automated Scanners** crawl dark web sites continuously
2. **AI Analysis** identifies personal information in listings
3. **Database Matching** compares findings against monitored data
4. **Alert Generation** notifies you of matches
5. **Recommendations** guide you on protective actions

## Limitations of Dark Web Monitoring

### It's Reactive, Not Preventive
Monitoring tells you after your data is exposed, not before.

### Coverage Varies
No service monitors 100% of the dark web - it's too vast and constantly changing.

### False Negatives
Your data could be exposed on unmonitored channels.

## Dark Web Monitoring + Data Removal = Better Protection

Dark web monitoring alone is like smoke detectors without fire prevention. For real protection:

1. **Remove your data** from data brokers (reduces what can be stolen)
2. **Monitor for breaches** (catch exposures early)
3. **Scan the dark web** (detect criminal activity)
4. **Take action** on alerts (mitigate damage)

## GhostMyData's Approach

Our Enterprise plan combines:

- **Data broker removal** - Reduce your exposed footprint
- **Breach monitoring** - Catch exposures immediately
- **Dark web surveillance** - Monitor criminal marketplaces
- **Actionable alerts** - Know exactly what to do

This layered approach provides comprehensive identity protection.

Identity theft affects millions of Americans every year:

- **15 million** Americans are victims annually
- **$52 billion** in losses
- **Average victim** spends 200+ hours recovering
- **1 in 3** Americans will experience identity theft

## 10 Ways to Protect Yourself

### 1. Remove Your Data from Data Brokers

Data brokers are goldmines for identity thieves. They provide:
- Your full name and aliases
- Current and past addresses
- Phone numbers
- Relatives' names
- And much more...

**Action**: Use GhostMyData to automatically remove your information from 2,100+ data brokers.

### 2. Use Unique Passwords Everywhere

Password reuse is the #1 cause of account compromise.

**Action**:
- Use a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden)
- Generate unique 16+ character passwords
- Never reuse passwords across sites

### 3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks.

**Action**: Enable 2FA on:
- Email accounts
- Banking and financial sites
- Social media
- Shopping sites
- Use authenticator apps over SMS when possible

### 4. Freeze Your Credit

A credit freeze prevents new accounts being opened in your name.

**Action**: Freeze your credit at all three bureaus:
- Equifax: equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services
- Experian: experian.com/freeze
- TransUnion: transunion.com/credit-freeze

It's free and can be temporarily lifted when needed.

### 5. Monitor Your Credit Reports

Check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries.

**Action**:
- Get free reports at annualcreditreport.com
- Stagger requests (one bureau every 4 months)
- Look for accounts you didn't open
- Check for incorrect information

### 6. Be Phishing-Aware

Most breaches start with phishing emails.

**Action**:
- Don't click links in unexpected emails
- Verify sender addresses carefully
- When in doubt, go to the website directly
- Use email filtering and security tools

### 7. Secure Your Mail

Physical mail theft is still common.

**Action**:
- Use USPS Informed Delivery
- Switch to paperless statements
- Shred sensitive documents
- Use a locked mailbox

### 8. Limit Social Media Exposure

Oversharing provides answers to security questions.

**Action**:
- Don't post birthday, hometown, pet names
- Review privacy settings regularly

- Avoid location check-ins

### 9. Monitor Your Accounts

Early detection limits damage.

**Action**:
- Enable transaction alerts on all accounts
- Review statements regularly
- Set up credit monitoring alerts
- Check medical insurance statements

### 10. Use Dark Web Monitoring

Know when your data appears on criminal marketplaces.

**Action**: Use a dark web monitoring service like GhostMyData Enterprise to get alerts when your information appears on the dark web.

## What to Do If You're a Victim

1. **Place fraud alerts** with credit bureaus
2. **File an FTC report** at identitytheft.gov
3. **File a police report** for documentation
4. **Close compromised accounts**
5. **Create new accounts** with strong security
