## What is a Data Broker?

A data broker (also called an information broker or data vendor) is a company that collects personal information about individuals and sells it to other businesses or individuals. These companies operate largely in the shadows, gathering data from hundreds of sources without most people's knowledge or consent.

## The Data Broker Industry by the Numbers

- **4,000+** data broker companies operate in the US alone
- **$200+ billion** annual industry revenue
- **Average person** has their data on 50+ data broker sites (we scan 2,100+)
- **1,500+ data points** collected per person on average

## How Data Brokers Collect Your Information

### Public Records
- Voter registration
- Property records
- Court records
- Marriage and divorce records
- Birth and death records
- Business filings

### Online Activity
- Social media profiles
- Website cookies and tracking
- Online purchases
- Search history
- App usage data

Employers, landlords, and insurers may use data broker information to discriminate.

## Introduction to Privacy Laws

Privacy laws give you control over your personal data. The two most significant are:

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) - European Union
- **CCPA/CPRA** (California Consumer Privacy Act) - California, USA

Understanding these laws is essential for protecting your privacy in the digital age.

## GDPR Overview

The GDPR, enacted in 2018, is the world's strongest privacy law. It applies to any company processing data of EU residents, regardless of where the company is located.

### GDPR Key Rights

1. **Right of Access** - Know what data companies have about you
2. **Right to Rectification** - Correct inaccurate data
3. **Right to Erasure** - Request deletion ("right to be forgotten")
4. **Right to Restrict Processing** - Limit how your data is used
5. **Right to Data Portability** - Get your data in a usable format
6. **Right to Object** - Opt out of certain processing
7. **Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making** - Human review of AI decisions

### GDPR Penalties

Companies can be fined up to:
- €20 million, or
- 4% of global annual revenue (whichever is higher)

## CCPA/CPRA Overview

The CCPA (2020) and its amendment CPRA (2023) give California residents significant privacy rights. Many US states are adopting similar laws.

### CCPA Key Rights

1. **Right to Know** - What data is collected and how it's used
2. **Right to Delete** - Request deletion of your data
3. **Right to Opt-Out** - Stop the sale of your personal information
4. **Right to Non-Discrimination** - Companies can't penalize you for exercising rights
5. **Right to Correct** - Fix inaccurate information (added by CPRA)
6. **Right to Limit** - Restrict use of sensitive personal information (CPRA)

### CCPA Penalties

- $2,500 per unintentional violation
- $7,500 per intentional violation
- Private right of action for data breaches

## CCPA vs GDPR: Key Differences

| Aspect | GDPR | CCPA |
|--------|------|------|
| **Scope** | EU residents | California residents |
| **Opt-in vs Opt-out** | Requires opt-in consent | Allows opt-out of sales |
| **Data Covered** | All personal data | Excludes some employee/B2B data |
| **Enforcement** | Data Protection Authorities | California AG + private lawsuits |
| **Penalties** | Up to 4% global revenue | $2,500-$7,500 per violation |

## How to Exercise Your Rights

### Under GDPR
1. Find the company's Data Protection Officer (DPO) contact
2. Submit a "Subject Access Request" or deletion request
3. Company must respond within 30 days
4. Free of charge (usually)

### Under CCPA
1. Look for "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link
2. Submit opt-out or deletion request
3. Company must respond within 45 days
4. May need to verify your identity

## Using Privacy Laws Against Data Brokers

Data brokers are required to comply with CCPA and GDPR. You can:

1. **Request your data** - See what they have on you
2. **Request deletion** - Remove your information
3. **Opt out of sales** - Stop them from selling your data
4. **File complaints** - Report non-compliance to authorities

## GhostMyData Does the Heavy Lifting

Manually exercising your rights with hundreds of data brokers is impractical. GhostMyData:

- Submits CCPA/GDPR requests automatically
- Tracks response times and compliance
- Re-submits when companies don't comply
- Documents everything for potential complaints

## What is the Dark Web?

The dark web is a hidden part of the internet that requires special software (like Tor) to access. While it has legitimate uses, it's also where criminals buy, sell, and trade:

- Stolen personal information
- Login credentials
- Credit card numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Medical records
- Corporate data

## How Your Data Ends Up on the Dark Web

### Data Breaches
When companies are hacked, stolen databases are often sold on dark web marketplaces.

### Phishing Attacks
Criminals trick people into revealing credentials, then sell them in bulk.

### Malware
Keyloggers and info-stealers harvest data from infected computers.

### Data Broker Leaks
Even data brokers get breached, exposing aggregated personal information.

### Insider Threats
Employees sometimes steal and sell customer data.

## What's Sold on the Dark Web

| Data Type | Typical Price |
|-----------|---------------|
| Email + Password | $1-10 |
| Credit Card | $5-20 |
| Full Identity (SSN, DOB, etc.) | $15-100 |
| Bank Account Login | $50-200 |
| Medical Records | $100-1,000 |
| Passport Scans | $100-500 |

## What is Dark Web Monitoring?

Dark web monitoring services scan dark web marketplaces, forums, and paste sites to detect when your personal information appears. When your data is found, you're alerted so you can take action.

### What Gets Monitored

- Email addresses
- Passwords (hashed)
- Social Security Numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Bank account numbers
- Phone numbers
- Passport numbers
- Medical ID numbers

## How Dark Web Monitoring Works

1. **Automated Scanners** crawl dark web sites continuously
2. **AI Analysis** identifies personal information in listings
3. **Database Matching** compares findings against monitored data
4. **Alert Generation** notifies you of matches
5. **Recommendations** guide you on protective actions

## Limitations of Dark Web Monitoring

### It's Reactive, Not Preventive
Monitoring tells you after your data is exposed, not before.

### Coverage Varies
No service monitors 100% of the dark web - it's too vast and constantly changing.

### False Negatives
Your data could be exposed on unmonitored channels.

## Dark Web Monitoring + Data Removal = Better Protection

Dark web monitoring alone is like smoke detectors without fire prevention. For real protection:

1. **Remove your data** from data brokers (reduces what can be stolen)
2. **Monitor for breaches** (catch exposures early)
3. **Scan the dark web** (detect criminal activity)
4. **Take action** on alerts (mitigate damage)

## GhostMyData's Approach

Our Enterprise plan combines:

- **Data broker removal** - Reduce your exposed footprint
- **Breach monitoring** - Catch exposures immediately
- **Dark web surveillance** - Monitor criminal marketplaces
- **Actionable alerts** - Know exactly what to do

This layered approach provides comprehensive identity protection.

## Your Email Is on the Dark Web - Now What?

Discovering your email address on the dark web can be alarming, but it's increasingly common. Here's what you need to know and do.

## What It Means

When your email appears on the dark web, it typically means:

- **Data breach** - A service you used was hacked
- **Credential dump** - Your email/password combo is being sold
- **Phishing target** - You may receive more scam attempts
- **Spam lists** - Expect increased spam

## Immediate Steps to Take

### 1. Don't Panic

An exposed email alone is not catastrophic. The risk increases if:
- Your password was also exposed
- You reuse passwords across sites
- Sensitive accounts use this email

### 2. Change Passwords

Change passwords for:
- The email account itself
- Any accounts using that email
- Prioritize: banking, social media, shopping

### 3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Add 2FA to all important accounts:
- Use authenticator apps (not SMS)
- Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password
- Priority: email, banking, social media

### 4. Check for Unauthorized Access

Review recent activity on:
- Email account (sent items, login history)
- Banking accounts
- Social media accounts
- Shopping accounts

### 5. Monitor for Phishing

Expect increased phishing attempts:
- Verify sender addresses carefully
- Don't click suspicious links
- When in doubt, go directly to websites

## Long-Term Protection

### Use Unique Passwords

- One unique password per account
- Use a password manager
- Make passwords 16+ characters

### Create Email Aliases

- Use email aliases for signups
- Apple Hide My Email
- Firefox Relay
- SimpleLogin

### Regular Breach Monitoring

- Check HaveIBeenPwned regularly
- Use GhostMyData's breach monitoring
- Enable breach alerts

## Why Emails End Up on the Dark Web

1. **Company breaches** - LinkedIn, Adobe, Dropbox, etc.
2. **Phishing attacks** - Credentials stolen via fake sites
3. **Malware** - Keyloggers harvest your data
4. **Data broker breaches** - Even data brokers get hacked

## Reduce Your Exposure

The less data about you online, the less can be breached:

- Remove from data brokers
- Minimize online accounts
- Use privacy-focused services

## GhostMyData Protection

We help protect your email through:

- **Breach monitoring** - Instant alerts when email appears in breaches
- **Dark web surveillance** - Monitor criminal marketplaces
- **Data broker removal** - Reduce your exposed footprint

## Your Password Is Compromised - Act Now

A password appearing on the dark web is more serious than just an email leak. Criminals can directly access your accounts.

## Immediate Actions (Do These Now)

### 1. Change the Password Immediately

- Log into the affected service
- Change to a new, unique password
- Make it 16+ characters
- Use a password generator

### 2. Change It Everywhere You Used It

If you reused this password:
- Change it on ALL sites where you used it
- Each site needs a unique password
- Start with financial accounts

### 3. Enable 2FA Everywhere

Two-factor authentication stops most attacks:
- Email accounts (highest priority)
- Banking and financial
- Social media
- Shopping sites

### 4. Check for Unauthorized Access

Look for signs of compromise:
- Unfamiliar login locations
- Password reset emails you didn't request
- Unknown transactions
- Posts you didn't make

## Understanding the Risk

### What Attackers Do with Passwords

- **Credential stuffing** - Try your password on hundreds of sites
- **Account takeover** - Lock you out, take over accounts
- **Financial fraud** - Access banking, shopping accounts
- **Identity theft** - Use accounts to impersonate you

### Why Password Reuse is Dangerous

If you use the same password:
- One breach compromises all accounts
- Attackers automate testing across sites
- They'll find where it works

## Proper Password Security

### Use a Password Manager

- 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane
- Generates unique passwords
- Stores them securely
- Auto-fills when needed

### Create Strong Passwords

- Minimum 16 characters
- Random characters or passphrases
- Never reuse across sites
- Update regularly for sensitive accounts

### Enable 2FA Types (Best to Worst)

1. Hardware keys (YubiKey)
2. Authenticator apps
3. Push notifications
4. SMS codes (better than nothing)

## After the Immediate Crisis

- Set up breach monitoring
- Review all online accounts
- Close unused accounts
- Consider a credit freeze

## GhostMyData Helps

- **Breach alerts** - Know instantly when passwords leak
- **Dark web monitoring** - Track criminal marketplaces
- **Proactive protection** - Reduce your attack surface
