## What is a Data Broker?

A data broker (also called an information broker or data vendor) is a company that collects personal information about individuals and sells it to other businesses or individuals. These companies operate largely in the shadows, gathering data from hundreds of sources without most people's knowledge or consent.

## The Data Broker Industry by the Numbers

- **4,000+** data broker companies operate in the US alone
- **$200+ billion** annual industry revenue
- **Average person** has their data on 50+ data broker sites (we scan 2,100+)
- **1,500+ data points** collected per person on average

## How Data Brokers Collect Your Information

### Public Records
- Voter registration
- Property records
- Court records
- Marriage and divorce records
- Birth and death records
- Business filings

### Online Activity
- Social media profiles
- Website cookies and tracking
- Online purchases
- Search history
- App usage data

### Commercial Sources
- Loyalty programs
- Credit card transactions

## Introduction to Privacy Laws

Privacy laws give you control over your personal data. The two most significant are:

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) - European Union
- **CCPA/CPRA** (California Consumer Privacy Act) - California, USA

Understanding these laws is essential for protecting your privacy in the digital age.

## GDPR Overview

The GDPR, enacted in 2018, is the world's strongest privacy law. It applies to any company processing data of EU residents, regardless of where the company is located.

### GDPR Key Rights

1. **Right of Access** - Know what data companies have about you
2. **Right to Rectification** - Correct inaccurate data
3. **Right to Erasure** - Request deletion ("right to be forgotten")
4. **Right to Restrict Processing** - Limit how your data is used
5. **Right to Data Portability** - Get your data in a usable format
6. **Right to Object** - Opt out of certain processing
7. **Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making** - Human review of AI decisions

### GDPR Penalties

Companies can be fined up to:
- €20 million, or
- 4% of global annual revenue (whichever is higher)

## CCPA/CPRA Overview

The CCPA (2020) and its amendment CPRA (2023) give California residents significant privacy rights. Many US states are adopting similar laws.

### CCPA Key Rights

1. **Right to Know** - What data is collected and how it's used
2. **Right to Delete** - Request deletion of your data
3. **Right to Opt-Out** - Stop the sale of your personal information
4. **Right to Non-Discrimination** - Companies can't penalize you for exercising rights
5. **Right to Correct** - Fix inaccurate information (added by CPRA)
6. **Right to Limit** - Restrict use of sensitive personal information (CPRA)

### CCPA Penalties

- $2,500 per unintentional violation
- $7,500 per intentional violation
- Private right of action for data breaches

## CCPA vs GDPR: Key Differences

| Aspect | GDPR | CCPA |
|--------|------|------|
| **Scope** | EU residents | California residents |
| **Opt-in vs Opt-out** | Requires opt-in consent | Allows opt-out of sales |
| **Data Covered** | All personal data | Excludes some employee/B2B data |
| **Enforcement** | Data Protection Authorities | California AG + private lawsuits |
| **Penalties** | Up to 4% global revenue | $2,500-$7,500 per violation |

## How to Exercise Your Rights

### Under GDPR
1. Find the company's Data Protection Officer (DPO) contact
2. Submit a "Subject Access Request" or deletion request
3. Company must respond within 30 days
4. Free of charge (usually)

### Under CCPA
1. Look for "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link
2. Submit opt-out or deletion request
3. Company must respond within 45 days
4. May need to verify your identity

## Using Privacy Laws Against Data Brokers

Data brokers are required to comply with CCPA and GDPR. You can:

1. **Request your data** - See what they have on you
2. **Request deletion** - Remove your information
3. **Opt out of sales** - Stop them from selling your data
4. **File complaints** - Report non-compliance to authorities

## GhostMyData Does the Heavy Lifting

Manually exercising your rights with hundreds of data brokers is impractical. GhostMyData:

- Submits CCPA/GDPR requests automatically
- Tracks response times and compliance
- Re-submits when companies don't comply
- Documents everything for potential complaints

## What is the Dark Web?

The dark web is a hidden part of the internet that requires special software (like Tor) to access. While it has legitimate uses, it's also where criminals buy, sell, and trade:

- Stolen personal information
- Login credentials
- Credit card numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Medical records
- Corporate data

## How Your Data Ends Up on the Dark Web

### Data Breaches
When companies are hacked, stolen databases are often sold on dark web marketplaces.

### Phishing Attacks
Criminals trick people into revealing credentials, then sell them in bulk.

### Malware
Keyloggers and info-stealers harvest data from infected computers.

### Data Broker Leaks
Even data brokers get breached, exposing aggregated personal information.

### Insider Threats
Employees sometimes steal and sell customer data.

## What's Sold on the Dark Web

| Data Type | Typical Price |
|-----------|---------------|
| Email + Password | $1-10 |
| Credit Card | $5-20 |
| Full Identity (SSN, DOB, etc.) | $15-100 |
| Bank Account Login | $50-200 |
| Medical Records | $100-1,000 |
| Passport Scans | $100-500 |

## What is Dark Web Monitoring?

Dark web monitoring services scan dark web marketplaces, forums, and paste sites to detect when your personal information appears. When your data is found, you're alerted so you can take action.

### What Gets Monitored

- Email addresses
- Passwords (hashed)
- Social Security Numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Bank account numbers
- Phone numbers
- Passport numbers
- Medical ID numbers

## How Dark Web Monitoring Works

1. **Automated Scanners** crawl dark web sites continuously
2. **AI Analysis** identifies personal information in listings
3. **Database Matching** compares findings against monitored data
4. **Alert Generation** notifies you of matches
5. **Recommendations** guide you on protective actions

## Limitations of Dark Web Monitoring

### It's Reactive, Not Preventive
Monitoring tells you after your data is exposed, not before.

### Coverage Varies
No service monitors 100% of the dark web - it's too vast and constantly changing.

### False Negatives
Your data could be exposed on unmonitored channels.

## Dark Web Monitoring + Data Removal = Better Protection

Dark web monitoring alone is like smoke detectors without fire prevention. For real protection:

1. **Remove your data** from data brokers (reduces what can be stolen)
2. **Monitor for breaches** (catch exposures early)
3. **Scan the dark web** (detect criminal activity)
4. **Take action** on alerts (mitigate damage)

## GhostMyData's Approach

Our Enterprise plan combines:

- **Data broker removal** - Reduce your exposed footprint
- **Breach monitoring** - Catch exposures immediately
- **Dark web surveillance** - Monitor criminal marketplaces
- **Actionable alerts** - Know exactly what to do

This layered approach provides comprehensive identity protection.

## Your Email Is on the Dark Web - Now What?

Discovering your email address on the dark web can be alarming, but it's increasingly common. Here's what you need to know and do.

## What It Means

When your email appears on the dark web, it typically means:

- **Data breach** - A service you used was hacked
- **Credential dump** - Your email/password combo is being sold
- **Phishing target** - You may receive more scam attempts
- **Spam lists** - Expect increased spam

## Immediate Steps to Take

### 1. Don't Panic

An exposed email alone is not catastrophic. The risk increases if:
- Your password was also exposed
- You reuse passwords across sites
- Sensitive accounts use this email

### 2. Change Passwords

Change passwords for:
- The email account itself
- Any accounts using that email
- Prioritize: banking, social media, shopping

### 3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Add 2FA to all important accounts:
- Use authenticator apps (not SMS)
- Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password
- Priority: email, banking, social media

### 4. Check for Unauthorized Access

Review recent activity on:
- Email account (sent items, login history)
- Banking accounts
- Social media accounts
- Shopping accounts

### 5. Monitor for Phishing

Expect increased phishing attempts:
- Verify sender addresses carefully
- Don't click suspicious links
- When in doubt, go directly to websites

## Long-Term Protection

### Use Unique Passwords

- One unique password per account
- Use a password manager
- Make passwords 16+ characters

### Create Email Aliases

- Use email aliases for signups
- Apple Hide My Email
- Firefox Relay
- SimpleLogin

### Regular Breach Monitoring

- Check HaveIBeenPwned regularly
- Use GhostMyData's breach monitoring
- Enable breach alerts

## Why Emails End Up on the Dark Web

1. **Company breaches** - LinkedIn, Adobe, Dropbox, etc.
2. **Phishing attacks** - Credentials stolen via fake sites
3. **Malware** - Keyloggers harvest your data
4. **Data broker breaches** - Even data brokers get hacked

## Reduce Your Exposure

The less data about you online, the less can be breached:

- Remove from data brokers
- Minimize online accounts
- Use privacy-focused services

## GhostMyData Protection

We help protect your email through:

- **Breach monitoring** - Instant alerts when email appears in breaches
- **Dark web surveillance** - Monitor criminal marketplaces
- **Data broker removal** - Reduce your exposed footprint

## Your Password Is Compromised - Act Now

A password appearing on the dark web is more serious than just an email leak. Criminals can directly access your accounts.

## Immediate Actions (Do These Now)

### 1. Change the Password Immediately

- Log into the affected service
- Change to a new, unique password
- Make it 16+ characters
- Use a password generator

### 2. Change It Everywhere You Used It

If you reused this password:
- Change it on ALL sites where you used it
- Each site needs a unique password
- Start with financial accounts

### 3. Enable 2FA Everywhere

Two-factor authentication stops most attacks:
- Email accounts (highest priority)
- Banking and financial
- Social media
- Shopping sites

### 4. Check for Unauthorized Access

Look for signs of compromise:
- Unfamiliar login locations
- Password reset emails you didn't request
- Unknown transactions
- Posts you didn't make

## Understanding the Risk

### What Attackers Do with Passwords

- **Credential stuffing** - Try your password on hundreds of sites
- **Account takeover** - Lock you out, take over accounts
- **Financial fraud** - Access banking, shopping accounts
- **Identity theft** - Use accounts to impersonate you

### Why Password Reuse is Dangerous

If you use the same password:
- One breach compromises all accounts
- Attackers automate testing across sites
- They'll find where it works

## Proper Password Security

### Use a Password Manager

- 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane
- Generates unique passwords
- Stores them securely
- Auto-fills when needed

### Create Strong Passwords

- Minimum 16 characters
- Random characters or passphrases
- Never reuse across sites
- Update regularly for sensitive accounts

### Enable 2FA Types (Best to Worst)

1. Hardware keys (YubiKey)
2. Authenticator apps
3. Push notifications
4. SMS codes (better than nothing)

## After the Immediate Crisis

- Set up breach monitoring
- Review all online accounts
- Close unused accounts
- Consider a credit freeze

## GhostMyData Helps

- **Breach alerts** - Know instantly when passwords leak
- **Dark web monitoring** - Track criminal marketplaces
- **Proactive protection** - Reduce your attack surface

## What is SIM Swapping?

SIM swapping is when criminals convince your phone carrier to transfer your number to their SIM card. They then receive your calls, texts, and crucially - your 2FA codes.

## How SIM Swap Attacks Work

### Step 1: Information Gathering
Criminals collect your info from:
- Data brokers and people-search sites
- Social media profiles
- Data breaches
- Phishing attacks

### Step 2: Carrier Contact
They contact your carrier pretending to be you:
- Use gathered personal info
- Claim phone is lost/stolen
- Request SIM transfer

### Step 3: Number Takeover
Once successful:
- Your phone loses service
- They receive your calls/texts
- They get your 2FA codes

### Step 4: Account Compromise
They quickly:
- Reset passwords via SMS
- Access financial accounts
- Steal cryptocurrency
- Take over social media

## Warning Signs

- Sudden loss of cell service
- Unable to make calls/texts
- Notification of SIM change you didn't request
- Password reset emails you didn't initiate

## Protection Measures

### Carrier Security

**Add a PIN/Passcode**
- Call your carrier to add a transfer PIN
- Required for any SIM changes
- Different from voicemail PIN

**Port Freeze**
- Some carriers offer port freeze
- Prevents number transfers
- Requires extra verification to remove

**Account Alerts**
- Enable SIM change notifications
- Account modification alerts
- Login notifications

### Authentication Security

**Move Away from SMS 2FA**
Use instead:
- Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Hardware keys (YubiKey)
- Push notifications

**Email Security**
- Your email is your master key
- Use strongest protection on email
- Never use SMS 2FA for email

### Reduce Data Exposure

Less exposed data = harder to impersonate you:
- Remove from data brokers
- Minimize social media sharing
- Protect date of birth, address, SSN

## What to Do If SIM Swapped

1. **Contact carrier immediately** - Report the swap
2. **Regain your number** - May require ID verification
3. **Change all passwords** - Assume accounts compromised
4. **Check financial accounts** - Look for fraud
5. **Enable non-SMS 2FA** - Prevent future attacks
6. **File reports** - FTC, local police

## GhostMyData Reduces SIM Swap Risk

We remove the data criminals need:
- Personal info from data brokers
- Address and phone details
- Information enabling impersonation

## What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is psychological manipulation that tricks people into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information. It exploits human nature rather than technical vulnerabilities.

## Common Social Engineering Tactics

### Pretexting
Creating a fabricated scenario:
- "This is IT, we need your password"
- "I'm from the bank fraud department"
- "There's been an accident, I need your info"

### Phishing
Deceptive communications:
- Fake emails from trusted brands
- Fraudulent text messages
- Impersonation websites

### Baiting
Offering something enticing:
- Free USB drives (infected)
- Too-good-to-be-true offers
- Fake prize notifications

### Quid Pro Quo
Offering a service in exchange:
- Fake tech support
- Survey rewards for info
- Help in exchange for access

### Tailgating
Physical access exploitation:
- Following employees into buildings
- Impersonating delivery persons
- Exploiting courtesy

## Why Social Engineering Works

### Psychological Triggers
- **Authority** - We comply with authority figures
- **Urgency** - Pressure reduces critical thinking
- **Fear** - Threats cloud judgment
- **Reciprocity** - We feel obligated to return favors
- **Social proof** - We follow others' actions
- **Liking** - We trust people we like

## Protection Strategies

### Verify Independently
- Don't use contact info provided by caller
- Look up official numbers independently
- Call back through verified channels

### Question Urgency
- Legitimate organizations allow verification time
- Pressure = red flag
- Pause before acting

### Protect Information
- Never share passwords
- Verify identity before sharing data
- Question unusual requests

### Be Skeptical
- If it seems too good, it is
- Authority can be faked
- Verify through other channels

### Secure Your Data
- Less available info = harder to manipulate
- Remove from data brokers
- Limit social media sharing

## Common Scenarios

### Fake Tech Support
"Microsoft" calls about virus:
- Microsoft doesn't call unsolicited
- Never give remote access
- Hang up and ignore

### IRS/Government Impersonation
Threatening calls about taxes:
- IRS contacts by mail first
- Never demands gift cards
- Verify through irs.gov

### Business Email Compromise
Boss emails requesting wire transfer:
- Verify through known phone number
- Question unusual requests
- Confirm in person if possible

### Romance Scams
Online relationship asking for money:
- Never send money to online contacts
- Video verify identity
- Be wary of overseas contacts

## The Identity Theft Crisis

Identity theft affects millions of Americans every year:

- **15 million** Americans are victims annually
- **$52 billion** in losses
- **Average victim** spends 200+ hours recovering
- **1 in 3** Americans will experience identity theft

## 10 Ways to Protect Yourself

### 1. Remove Your Data from Data Brokers

Data brokers are goldmines for identity thieves. They provide:
- Your full name and aliases
- Current and past addresses
- Phone numbers
- Relatives' names
- And much more...

**Action**: Use GhostMyData to automatically remove your information from 2,100+ data brokers.

### 2. Use Unique Passwords Everywhere

Password reuse is the #1 cause of account compromise.

**Action**:
- Use a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden)
- Generate unique 16+ character passwords
- Never reuse passwords across sites

### 3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks.

**Action**: Enable 2FA on:
- Email accounts
- Banking and financial sites
- Social media
- Shopping sites
- Use authenticator apps over SMS when possible

### 4. Freeze Your Credit

A credit freeze prevents new accounts being opened in your name.

**Action**: Freeze your credit at all three bureaus:
- Equifax: equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services
- Experian: experian.com/freeze
- TransUnion: transunion.com/credit-freeze

It's free and can be temporarily lifted when needed.

### 5. Monitor Your Credit Reports

Check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries.

**Action**:
- Get free reports at annualcreditreport.com
- Stagger requests (one bureau every 4 months)
- Look for accounts you didn't open
- Check for incorrect information

### 6. Be Phishing-Aware

Most breaches start with phishing emails.

**Action**:
- Don't click links in unexpected emails
- Verify sender addresses carefully
- When in doubt, go to the website directly
- Use email filtering and security tools

### 7. Secure Your Mail

Physical mail theft is still common.

**Action**:
- Use USPS Informed Delivery
- Switch to paperless statements
- Shred sensitive documents
- Use a locked mailbox

### 8. Limit Social Media Exposure

Oversharing provides answers to security questions.

**Action**:
- Don't post birthday, hometown, pet names
- Review privacy settings regularly
- Be selective with friend requests
- Avoid location check-ins

### 9. Monitor Your Accounts

Early detection limits damage.

**Action**:
- Enable transaction alerts on all accounts
- Review statements regularly
- Set up credit monitoring alerts
- Check medical insurance statements

### 10. Use Dark Web Monitoring

Know when your data appears on criminal marketplaces.

**Action**: Use a dark web monitoring service like GhostMyData Enterprise to get alerts when your information appears on the dark web.

## What to Do If You're a Victim

1. **Place fraud alerts** with credit bureaus
2. **File an FTC report** at identitytheft.gov
3. **File a police report** for documentation
4. **Close compromised accounts**
5. **Create new accounts** with strong security
6. **Monitor** for additional fraud

## Most Privacy Services Don't Know What a Data Broker Actually Is

Ask ten privacy companies to define "data broker" and you'll get ten different answers. Some include dating apps. Others list background check companies. A few even target review platforms like Yelp.

The problem? California law already defines it. And most privacy services are getting it wrong.

## The Legal Definition: CA Civil Code Section 1798.99.80

The California Delete Act (SB 362, effective January 2024) provides the clearest statutory definition of a data broker in the United States:

**A "data broker" is a business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.**

The critical phrase is **"does not have a direct relationship."** This single test separates legitimate data brokers from companies that collect your data because you gave it to them.

## The Direct Relationship Test

Under CA Civil Code Section 1798.99.80(d), a company is NOT a data broker if it has a direct relationship with the consumer whose data it holds. This means:

### Companies That ARE Data Brokers

- **People-search sites** (Spokeo, WhitePages, BeenVerified) — they aggregate your data from public records without your knowledge or consent
- **Data aggregators** (Acxiom, Oracle Data Cloud, LexisNexis Risk Solutions) — they buy, compile, and resell consumer data at scale
- **Marketing data companies** (Datalogix, Epsilon, LiveRamp) — they build consumer profiles from purchased data

### Companies That Are NOT Data Brokers

- **Dating apps** (Match.com, Bumble, Hinge) — you created an account and voluntarily provided your data
- **Background check firms** (HireRight, Sterling, Checkr) — subjects consent under FCRA Section 604 before any check is run
- **Review platforms** (Trustpilot, ConsumerAffairs) — users voluntarily post their own reviews
- **Real estate platforms** (Zillow, Redfin) — they aggregate public county records but also maintain direct user relationships

## Why This Distinction Matters

### For Consumers

If a privacy service sends unauthorized removal demands to companies that aren't data brokers, several things can happen:

1. **Your requests get ignored** — the company has no legal obligation to comply
2. **It wastes your time** — every failed request is a removal that could have targeted an actual broker
3. **It can backfire** — companies may flag your account or take legal action against the service

### For the Industry

When privacy services send thousands of removal requests to non-brokers, it undermines the entire data removal industry:

- Companies start ignoring legitimate requests because they're overwhelmed with invalid ones
- Regulators question whether the industry understands the laws it claims to enforce
- Consumers lose trust when they see "removals" from sites that were never data brokers

## The California Data Broker Registry

California maintains an official data broker registry at the California Privacy Protection Agency. Every company that meets the statutory definition must register and pay an annual fee.

**Key facts about the registry:**
- Over 500 registered data brokers as of 2026
- Companies face fines of $200 per day for failing to register
- The Delete Act requires brokers to honor deletion requests within 45 days
- Registration is public — anyone can verify if a company is a registered broker

If a company is NOT on California's registry and does NOT meet the statutory definition, sending them a "data broker removal request" has no legal basis.

## Gray Areas: Where It Gets Complicated

Some companies genuinely straddle the line:

- **Zillow** aggregates public property records (broker behavior) but also has millions of direct user accounts (direct relationship)
- **Healthgrades** compiles doctor data from public license records but also hosts patient reviews
- **Yelp** aggregates business data but is primarily a user-generated content platform

The honest answer is that these are legally ambiguous. At GhostMyData, we classify them as "gray area" and exclude them from automated removal requests until the legal landscape clarifies. We'd rather be accurate than aggressive.

## How GhostMyData Handles This

We built a compliance verification system that applies the statutory direct relationship test to every single entry in our broker directory:

1. **Legal classification** — every source is categorized as STATUTORY_DATA_BROKER, DIRECT_RELATIONSHIP, SERVICE_PROVIDER, GRAY_AREA, or MONITORING_ONLY
2. **Daily compliance monitoring** — automated checks verify opt-out URLs are healthy and classifications are current
3. **Weekly audits** — full directory review flags any entries that may need reclassification
4. **Conservative approach** — when in doubt, we exclude rather than risk sending unauthorized requests

The result: every removal request we send is backed by a verified legal basis under California law.

## What to Look for in a Privacy Service

When evaluating data removal services, ask these questions:

1. **Do they define "data broker" anywhere?** If not, they may be targeting the wrong companies.
2. **Do they reference specific privacy laws?** Legitimate services cite CCPA, the Delete Act, or GDPR.
3. **Do they distinguish between data brokers and other companies?** If they claim to remove you from "dating apps" or "review sites," they may not understand the law.
4. **Do they verify their broker directory?** Ask how often they audit their list and what legal standard they apply.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the legal definition of a data broker?

Under California Civil Code Section 1798.99.80, a data broker is a business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.

### Are dating apps data brokers?

No. Dating apps like Match.com, Bumble, and Hinge have direct relationships with their users — you create an account and voluntarily provide your data. They are excluded from the data broker definition under California law.

### Are background check companies data brokers?

Most consent-based background check companies (HireRight, Sterling, Checkr) are not data brokers because subjects consent to the check under FCRA Section 604. However, some companies like The Work Number (an Equifax subsidiary) collect employer data without employee consent and are registered on California's broker registry.

### How many data brokers are there?

California's official registry lists over 500 registered data brokers. The total number of companies that broker personal data globally is estimated at 4,000 or more, though many operate without registering as required by law.

### Can I remove my data from a company that isn't a data broker?

You can request deletion under CCPA or GDPR regardless of whether a company is a data broker. However, the specific "data broker deletion" rights under the California Delete Act only apply to registered data brokers.

## We Made a Mistake. Here's How We Fixed It.

In February 2026, we conducted a comprehensive legal audit of every company in our data broker directory. The result: we reclassified and removed 27 companies that don't meet the statutory definition of a data broker under California law.

This article explains exactly which companies we removed, why, and what it means for our users.

## What Happened

When we originally built our broker directory, we included every company that collects personal data and has an opt-out mechanism. That seemed reasonable — if they have your data and you can ask them to delete it, why not?

The problem: having an opt-out form doesn't make a company a data broker.

California Civil Code Section 1798.99.80 defines a data broker as a company that collects and sells personal data from consumers **with whom it does not have a direct relationship**. Many companies we included — dating apps, background check firms, review platforms — have direct relationships with their users.

## The Full List

### Dating Platforms Removed (6 companies)

- Match.com
- Bumble
- Hinge
- OkCupid
- Plenty of Fish
- Tinder

**Why:** Users create accounts and voluntarily provide their own profile data. These platforms have direct relationships with every person whose data they hold.

### Background Check Companies Removed (5 companies)

- HireRight
- Sterling
- Checkr
- GoodHire
- Accurate Background

**Why:** Subjects consent to background checks under FCRA Section 604 before any check is run. The company-subject relationship is direct and consent-based. (Note: The Work Number by Equifax was NOT removed — it's an Equifax subsidiary registered on California's broker registry that collects employment data from employers without employee consent.)

### Review and Content Platforms Removed (5 companies)

- Trustpilot
- ConsumerAffairs
- SiteJabber
- PissedConsumer
- ComplaintsBoard

**Why:** Users voluntarily post their own reviews and content. These are user-generated content platforms, not data brokers.

### Gray Area Companies Excluded (11 companies)

- Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, Trulia, Homes.com, HomeSnap, Movoto
- Healthgrades, Vitals
- Yelp, TripAdvisor

**Why:** These companies straddle the line — they aggregate public records (broker behavior) but also maintain direct user relationships. Rather than force a classification, we excluded them from automated removals pending clearer legal guidance.

## What This Means for Users

### Your removals are now 100% legally verified

Every company remaining in our directory meets the statutory definition of a data broker. When we send a removal request on your behalf, it's backed by California law.

### No removals were lost

We cancelled pending requests to reclassified companies, but these were requests that had no legal basis to begin with. Your removal count may look different, but the removals that matter — from actual data brokers — are unaffected.

### More accurate exposure counts

Your dashboard now shows exposures from verified data brokers only. Some users may see lower exposure counts, but these numbers are now legally accurate.

## Why We're Telling You This

Most companies would quietly make this change and hope no one noticed. We're publishing the full list because:

1. **Transparency builds trust** — you should know exactly which companies we're targeting and why
2. **It's the right thing to do** — sending unauthorized removal requests to non-brokers wastes everyone's time
3. **We want to raise the standard** — the data removal industry needs better compliance practices

## How We Prevent This Going Forward

We built automated compliance infrastructure to ensure our directory stays accurate:

- **Daily compliance monitoring** — every opt-out URL is health-checked daily
- **Weekly classification audits** — automated review flags any entries that may need reclassification
- **Legal classification system** — every source is tagged as STATUTORY_DATA_BROKER, DIRECT_RELATIONSHIP, SERVICE_PROVIDER, GRAY_AREA, or MONITORING_ONLY
- **Conservative defaults** — new sources default to excluded until manually verified

## The Bigger Picture

This experience highlighted a problem across the entire data removal industry: most services don't apply any legal standard to their broker lists. They target as many companies as possible because bigger numbers look better in marketing.

We believe the opposite: accuracy is more valuable than volume. One legally verified removal from an actual data broker is worth more than a hundred requests to companies that will ignore them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why were my removal counts different after the update?

We cancelled pending removal requests to companies that were reclassified as non-brokers. These requests had no legal basis and would not have resulted in actual data deletion.

### Can I still request removal from the companies you reclassified?

You can contact these companies directly under CCPA or GDPR to request data deletion. However, they are not data brokers under California law, and the specific Delete Act removal rights don't apply.

### Does this mean other privacy services are sending unauthorized requests?

We can't speak for other services, but many do include dating apps, background check companies, and review platforms in their removal lists. We encourage users to ask their provider what legal standard they apply.

### Will you add these companies back if the law changes?

If California or federal legislation expands the data broker definition, we'll update our directory accordingly. We review legal developments quarterly.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Data Removal Services

The data removal industry is booming. Dozens of services promise to delete your personal information from data brokers. They advertise coverage of hundreds or thousands of sites. They show dashboards full of "removals completed."

But here's the question nobody is asking: **how many of those removal requests are actually sent to data brokers?**

## The Scale of the Problem

Consider the typical data removal service's broker list. Many include:

- **Dating apps** like Match.com, Bumble, and Tinder
- **Background check companies** like HireRight and Sterling
- **Review platforms** like Yelp and Trustpilot
- **Real estate sites** like Zillow and Redfin
- **Healthcare directories** like Healthgrades

None of these are data brokers under California law.

California Civil Code Section 1798.99.80 explicitly excludes companies that have a "direct relationship" with the consumer whose data they hold. When you create a Match.com profile, voluntarily post a Yelp review, or consent to a background check, that company has a direct relationship with you.

Yet these companies regularly appear in "data broker removal" services.

## Why This Matters: Three Real Consequences

### 1. Consumers Get a False Sense of Security

When a service reports "150 removals completed" and 40 of those were to non-brokers that simply ignored the request, the user thinks they're more protected than they are. The 110 actual broker removals are real — but the inflated number creates a misleading picture.

### 2. Legitimate Requests Get Buried

Companies receiving thousands of legally baseless removal demands may start treating all removal requests with skepticism. A well-documented, legally grounded request from a verified service gets the same treatment as a mass-blast from a service that doesn't check its list.

This is the "crying wolf" effect. The more invalid requests the industry sends, the harder it becomes for valid requests to be taken seriously.

### 3. It Invites Legal Pushback

Companies that are incorrectly targeted as data brokers have started pushing back. We've seen cease-and-desist letters from companies asserting — correctly — that they are not data brokers and that removal requests to them have no legal basis.

If this pattern continues, it could lead to:
- Industry-wide legal challenges
- Regulatory scrutiny of privacy services themselves
- Companies lobbying for exemptions that could weaken actual data broker regulations

## The Root Cause: No Industry Standard

The data removal industry has no compliance standard. There's no certification body, no audit requirement, no minimum legal threshold for what constitutes a "data broker."

Most services build their broker lists using one of three approaches:

### Approach 1: The Kitchen Sink

Include every company that has personal data and any kind of opt-out mechanism. This maximizes the "number of brokers covered" marketing metric but includes many non-brokers.

### Approach 2: Copy the Competitors

Look at what other services include and match their list. This perpetuates errors across the industry — if one service incorrectly includes dating apps, others copy it.

### Approach 3: Apply a Legal Standard

Research the statutory definition in relevant jurisdictions (California, Vermont, GDPR) and verify each company against that standard. This produces a smaller but legally accurate list.

Almost no service uses Approach 3.

## What a Compliance Standard Should Look Like

We believe the industry needs a minimum standard for data broker verification. Here's what we propose:

### 1. Statutory Basis

Every company on a removal list should be verifiable against at least one statutory definition of "data broker." In the US, the primary standard is California Civil Code Section 1798.99.80.

### 2. Registry Cross-Reference

California maintains an official data broker registry. Companies that meet the statutory definition are required to register. Any broker list should be cross-referenced against this registry.

### 3. Direct Relationship Test

Before adding any company to a removal list, apply the direct relationship test: does the company have a direct relationship with the consumers whose data it holds? If yes, it's not a data broker.

### 4. Regular Audits

Broker classifications should be reviewed at least quarterly. Companies get acquired, change practices, and enter or leave the broker registry.

### 5. Transparency

Services should publish their classification methodology and be willing to explain why any specific company is or isn't on their list.

## The Competitor Landscape

We analyzed the public broker lists of five major data removal services. Here's what we found:

| Service | Claims to Cover | Includes Non-Brokers? |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| DeleteMe | 750+ sites | Some gray area sites |
| Incogni | 180+ brokers | Focuses on brokers |
| Optery | 600+ sites | Includes some non-brokers |
| Kanary | 400+ sites | Unclear methodology |
| GhostMyData | 2,100+ sources | Legally verified brokers only |

Note: Our higher number reflects the inclusion of subsidiary and alias tracking — many brokers operate under multiple names. Our actual unique parent broker count after compliance verification is smaller but legally complete.

## What GhostMyData Does Differently

After conducting our own compliance audit and removing 27 companies that didn't meet the legal standard, we built automated infrastructure to maintain compliance:

### Daily Monitoring
Every opt-out URL in our directory is health-checked daily. Broken links are flagged, and our team updates them within 24 hours.

### Weekly Classification Audits
An automated system reviews our entire directory against the statutory direct relationship test every Tuesday. Any flagged entries are reviewed by our team before any changes are made.

### Legal Classification Tags
Every source in our directory is tagged with a legal classification: STATUTORY_DATA_BROKER, DIRECT_RELATIONSHIP, SERVICE_PROVIDER, GRAY_AREA, or MONITORING_ONLY. Only verified statutory data brokers receive automated removal requests.

### Public Transparency
We publish our reclassification decisions and the reasoning behind them. When we removed 27 companies from our list, we wrote a [full public accounting](/blog/why-we-removed-companies-from-removal-list) of which companies and why.

## What Consumers Can Do

1. **Ask your privacy service what legal standard they apply.** If they can't answer, that's a red flag.
2. **Check the numbers.** If a service claims 500 "removals" in your first week, verify how many were from actual data brokers.
3. **Look for transparency.** Does the service publish its broker list? Can you see which specific companies it targets?
4. **Verify against California's registry.** If a company isn't registered and doesn't meet the statutory definition, removal requests to it have no legal basis.

## The Path Forward

The data removal industry is young and growing fast. Like any emerging industry, it needs standards. We believe that compliance — specifically, legal verification of every company targeted for removal — should be the baseline, not the differentiator.

We're sharing our methodology not because it gives us a competitive advantage (it does), but because the entire industry benefits when every service sends legally grounded requests. More accurate requests mean higher compliance rates, better relationships with brokers, and ultimately better outcomes for consumers.

The privacy industry exists to protect consumers. It's time we held ourselves to the same standard we demand from data brokers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if a data removal service targets actual data brokers?

Ask the service what legal definition of "data broker" they use. Look for references to specific statutes like California Civil Code Section 1798.99.80 or the California Delete Act (SB 362). If they can't cite a legal standard, their broker list may include non-brokers.

### What happens when a removal request is sent to a non-broker?

The company may ignore it (no legal obligation to respond), respond that they're not a data broker, or in some cases send a cease-and-desist letter to the service that sent it.

### Are there federal data broker laws?

As of 2026, there is no comprehensive federal data broker law. California's Delete Act is the strongest state-level regulation. Vermont requires data broker registration. Several other states have introduced similar legislation.

### How often should a broker directory be audited?

At minimum, quarterly. Companies change practices, get acquired, and enter or leave regulatory registries. GhostMyData runs daily URL health checks and weekly classification audits.

### What is the California Data Broker Registry?

It's an official registry maintained by the California Privacy Protection Agency where companies meeting the statutory definition of "data broker" must register annually. The registry is publicly searchable and includes over 500 registered brokers.

## Why Broker Verification Matters

When you sign up for a data removal service, you're trusting that service to send removal requests to the right companies. But how do you know the companies on their list are actually data brokers?

At GhostMyData, every single entry in our broker directory goes through a 4-layer verification process before we'll send a removal request on your behalf. Here's exactly how it works.

## Layer 1: Legal Classification

Every company in our directory is assigned one of six legal classifications based on California Civil Code Section 1798.99.80:

### STATUTORY_DATA_BROKER
Companies that collect and sell personal information from consumers with whom they have no direct relationship. These are the only companies that receive automated removal requests.

**Examples:** Spokeo, WhitePages, BeenVerified, Intelius, Radaris, TruePeopleSearch

### DIRECT_RELATIONSHIP
Companies where users create accounts and voluntarily provide their own data. NOT data brokers under California law.

**Examples:** Match.com, Bumble, HireRight, Trustpilot

### SERVICE_PROVIDER
Companies that process data on behalf of other businesses, not for their own commercial purposes.

**Examples:** SiteGround, Cloudflare, analytics platforms

### GRAY_AREA
Companies that exhibit both broker and non-broker characteristics. Excluded from automated removals pending legal clarification.

**Examples:** Zillow, Healthgrades, Yelp

### SOCIAL_PLATFORM
Social media companies where users create profiles and post content. Subject to CCPA/GDPR deletion rights but not data broker specific regulations.

**Examples:** LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram

### MONITORING_ONLY
Breach databases, dark web sources, and AI services that are monitored for exposure detection but cannot be "removed" from.

**Examples:** Have I Been Pwned, breach databases, facial recognition services

## Layer 2: California Registry Cross-Reference

California's Privacy Protection Agency maintains an official data broker registry. Under the Delete Act (SB 362), companies meeting the statutory definition must register annually or face fines of $200 per day.

We cross-reference our directory against this registry quarterly:

- **Registered brokers** receive the highest confidence classification
- **Unregistered companies meeting the definition** are flagged for manual review — they may be non-compliant with registration requirements, or they may not actually be brokers
- **Companies NOT on the registry** that also don't meet the statutory test are reclassified or removed

This registry check catches cases where a company's practices have changed. If a previously registered broker is removed from the registry, we investigate why.

## Layer 3: Daily URL Health Monitoring

A verified broker with a broken opt-out URL is effectively unremovable. Our compliance monitoring system checks every opt-out URL in our directory every day:

### What We Check
- HTTP response codes (200, 301, 404, 500, etc.)
- Response times
- SSL certificate validity
- Whether the opt-out form is actually functional

### How We Classify Health
- **Healthy:** 2xx or 3xx responses, or expected blocks (403, 405, 429 — these typically indicate a working but rate-limited form)
- **Broken:** 404 (not found), 410 (gone), or 5xx server errors
- **Network error:** DNS failures, timeouts — we retry before classifying as broken

### What Happens When a URL Breaks
1. Our system flags the broken URL immediately
2. We search for the broker's current opt-out page (companies often redesign their sites)
3. If found, we update the URL and verify it works
4. If the broker's opt-out page is truly gone, we investigate whether the company is still operating
5. Two companies in our directory (VerifyCheckPro and Zlate Stranky) were marked DEFUNCT after their opt-out infrastructure disappeared entirely

### Results
In our most recent audit, we found and fixed 21 broken opt-out URLs — 18 were corrected with new URLs, 2 companies were marked defunct, and 1 was reclassified as email-only removal.

## Layer 4: Weekly Classification Audits

Every Tuesday, an automated audit runs against our entire directory. It checks:

### Classification Consistency
- Does the company's classification match its actual behavior?
- Has the company been acquired or merged with another entity?
- Has the company changed its data collection practices?

### Subsidiary Tracking
Many data brokers operate under multiple brand names. For example:
- **Intelius** owns Instant Checkmate, TruthFinder, and several other people-search sites
- **Spokeo** operates under its main brand but pulls from dozens of data sources
- **PeopleConnect** operates multiple people-search brands

Our directory tracks these subsidiaries so that a single removal request to the parent company covers all related brands.

### Compliance Rate Monitoring
For each broker, we track:
- **Success rate:** What percentage of removal requests result in confirmed deletion?
- **Average response time:** How long does the broker typically take to process a request?
- **Opt-out URL health:** Is their removal form consistently available?

Brokers with consistently low success rates or unresponsive opt-out processes are flagged for review. In some cases, we switch from automated form submission to direct email or API-based removal methods.

## What We DON'T Expose

Our verification process generates data that's useful for internal operations but potentially harmful if exposed publicly:

- **False positive rates** — internal accuracy metrics that could be misinterpreted
- **Consecutive failure counts** — technical debugging data
- **Internal operational notes** — team communications about specific brokers
- **HTTP response details** — technical data that could be used to circumvent broker protections

We share broker success rates and health status with users because it helps set realistic expectations. We keep the rest internal to protect our process and our users.

## How This Compares to Industry Practice

Based on our research, most data removal services use a simpler approach:

| Practice | Industry Typical | GhostMyData |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Legal classification | None or informal | 6-tier statutory test |
| Registry cross-reference | Rare | Quarterly |
| URL health monitoring | Manual or none | Daily automated |
| Classification audits | Annual or never | Weekly automated |
| Public transparency | Minimal | Full methodology published |
| Subsidiary tracking | Basic | Comprehensive parent-child mapping |

## The Numbers

Our current directory includes:

- **2,100+ tracked sources** (including subsidiaries and aliases)
- **500+ verified statutory data brokers** that receive automated removal requests
- **27 reclassified** companies removed in our February 2026 compliance audit
- **21 broken URLs** fixed in the same audit cycle
- **100% opt-out URL health** across active brokers after corrections

## What This Means for You

When you see a removal request in your GhostMyData dashboard, you can be confident that:

1. The target company is a verified data broker under California law
2. The opt-out URL we used was health-checked within the last 24 hours
3. The company's classification was verified within the last 7 days
4. If the company operates subsidiaries, those are tracked and covered

We'd rather show you 500 verified broker removals than 1,000 that include non-brokers, broken links, and companies that will ignore the request.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many data brokers does GhostMyData cover?

Our directory tracks 2,100+ sources including subsidiaries and aliases. After compliance verification, approximately 500+ are classified as verified statutory data brokers that receive automated removal requests.

### How often is the broker directory updated?

Opt-out URLs are health-checked daily. Legal classifications are audited weekly. The California registry cross-reference happens quarterly. New brokers are added as they're discovered and verified.

### What happens if a broker's opt-out form breaks?

Our monitoring system detects the break within 24 hours. We search for the updated URL, verify it works, and update our directory. If the broker's opt-out process is permanently gone, we investigate and reclassify if necessary.

### Can I see which brokers have my data?

Yes. When you run a free scan, we check our verified broker directory and show you which brokers have your information. You can then request removal from any or all of them.

### Why don't you target more companies to maximize removals?

Because sending removal requests to non-brokers wastes your time, has no legal basis, and undermines the industry. We prioritize accuracy over volume — every removal we report is from a verified data broker.

## The Hidden Pipeline Feeding Scammers Your Data

Every year, Americans lose billions of dollars to scams. In 2024, the Federal Trade Commission received over 2.6 million fraud reports, with total losses exceeding $10 billion for the first time in history. But the question nobody asks often enough is: how do scammers get your personal information in the first place?

The answer might surprise you. It is not just phishing emails and data breaches. The single largest source of personal information for scammers is a $200+ billion industry most people have never heard of: data brokers.

Understanding how your information gets into the wrong hands is the first step toward stopping it.

## 1. Data Brokers: The #1 Source Scammers Rely On

Data brokers are companies that collect, aggregate, and sell personal information about individuals. There are over 4,000 data broker companies operating in the United States alone, and the average person appears on more than 50 data broker sites.

These companies collect everything about you:

- **Full name, aliases, and date of birth**
- **Current and past home addresses**
- **Cell phone numbers and landlines**
- **Email addresses**
- **Family members and associates**
- **Estimated income and net worth**
- **Political affiliation and religious views**
- **Health interests and purchasing habits**

### How Scammers Use Data Broker Information

Data brokers sell this information to anyone willing to pay, often with no verification of intent. A scammer can purchase a detailed profile about you for as little as $0.50 per record in bulk, or $20-40 for a single detailed report on a people-search site like Spokeo or BeenVerified.

Armed with your name, address, phone number, and family details, scammers can:

- **Craft convincing phishing emails** that reference your real address or family members
- **Call you by name** and reference personal details to build false trust
- **Impersonate your bank or utility company** using your real account details
- **File fraudulent tax returns** using your Social Security number and address
- **Open credit accounts** in your name

The Verizon 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that 68% of breaches involved a human element, meaning social engineering and credential theft. Data brokers provide the raw material that makes social engineering attacks convincing.

### Why Data Brokers Are Legal (For Now)

Most data brokers operate legally under current US law. They aggregate information from public records, commercial transactions, and online activity. However, laws are changing. California's Delete Act (SB 362) will require all registered data brokers to honor deletion requests through a centralized platform starting August 1, 2026.

Until then, the burden falls on you to request removal from each broker individually, or use an automated service like GhostMyData to [remove yourself from 2,100+ data brokers](/how-it-works).

## 2. Social Media Scraping

Social media platforms are gold mines for scammers. Even with privacy settings enabled, a surprising amount of personal information is publicly accessible.

### What Scammers Scrape from Social Media

- **Profile pictures** (used for catfishing and fake profiles)
- **Check-ins and location data** (reveals when you are away from home)
- **Friends and family lists** (used for "grandparent scams" and impersonation)
- **Employment details** (used for business email compromise)
- **Life events** (new home, new baby, retirement, used to target you with relevant scams)

### The Facebook Quiz Problem

Those "fun" quizzes asking your first car, your mother's maiden name, or the street you grew up on are collecting common security question answers. Scammers create these quizzes specifically to harvest this information.

### How to Protect Yourself

- Set all social media profiles to private
- Remove personal details like phone numbers and birthdays from public profiles
- Never share security question answers in quizzes or posts
- Audit your friends list regularly for accounts you do not recognize
- Disable location sharing on posts

## 3. Phishing and Social Engineering

Phishing is the direct approach: scammers contact you and trick you into revealing information. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received over 298,000 phishing complaints in 2023, making it the most reported cybercrime category.

### Modern Phishing Is Sophisticated

Today's phishing attacks are not the poorly spelled Nigerian prince emails of the past. Modern phishing includes:

- **Spear phishing**: Targeted emails referencing your real employer, recent purchases, or family members (often sourced from data brokers)
- **Smishing**: SMS-based phishing texts disguised as delivery notifications, bank alerts, or toll notices
- **Vishing**: Voice phishing calls from spoofed numbers that appear to be your bank or government agency
- **QR code phishing (quishing)**: Malicious QR codes placed on parking meters, restaurant menus, and fake flyers

### Red Flags to Watch For

- Urgency ("Your account will be closed in 24 hours")
- Requests for passwords, SSN, or credit card numbers
- Links that do not match the supposed sender's domain
- Unexpected attachments, especially .zip or .exe files
- Slight misspellings in email addresses or domains

## 4. Data Breaches

According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, there were 3,205 data compromises in 2023, affecting over 353 million individuals. Your information has almost certainly been exposed in at least one breach.

### Major Breaches That Exposed Millions

| Breach | Year | Records Exposed |
|--------|------|----------------|
| National Public Data | 2024 | 2.9 billion records |
| MOVEit | 2023 | 77 million |
| T-Mobile | 2023 | 37 million |
| LastPass | 2022 | 25 million |
| Equifax | 2017 | 147 million |

### What Happens After a Breach

Stolen data is typically sold on dark web marketplaces within days. A complete identity (name, SSN, DOB, address, credit card) sells for as little as $15-30. Email and password combinations sell for $1-5.

### How to Check If You Have Been Breached

- Use HaveIBeenPwned.com (free) to check your email addresses
- Enable breach notifications from your password manager
- Monitor your credit reports via AnnualCreditReport.com
- Consider a [free privacy scan from GhostMyData](/register) to see your full exposure

## 5. Public Records

Much of your personal information is a matter of public record, freely accessible to anyone who knows where to look:

- **Property records**: Your home address, purchase price, and mortgage details are public in most counties
- **Voter registration**: Your name, address, party affiliation, and voting history are accessible in many states
- **Court records**: Lawsuits, divorces, bankruptcies, and criminal cases are often publicly searchable
- **Business filings**: If you own a business, your name and address are typically public
- **Marriage and birth records**: Filed with county clerks and often searchable online

Data brokers systematically collect all of these records and combine them into comprehensive profiles. This is one of the primary reasons data brokers have so much information about you even if you have never signed up for anything.

## 6. Dumpster Diving and Mail Theft

It sounds old-fashioned, but physical information theft remains a real threat:

- **Pre-approved credit offers** contain your name and enough information for identity theft
- **Bank and medical statements** reveal account numbers and health information
- **Old tax documents** contain Social Security numbers
- **Utility bills** confirm your address and account details

### How to Protect Physical Documents

- Shred all documents containing personal information before discarding
- Opt out of pre-approved credit offers at OptOutPrescreen.com
- Use a locked mailbox or PO Box
- Switch to paperless billing and statements
- Pick up mail promptly, especially after an address change

## 7. Wi-Fi Eavesdropping and Malware

Public Wi-Fi networks at coffee shops, airports, and hotels are hunting grounds for data thieves:

- **Man-in-the-middle attacks**: Intercepting data between your device and the network
- **Evil twin networks**: Fake hotspots with names like "Free Airport WiFi"
- **Malware distribution**: Infected apps or downloads that log keystrokes

### Protection Steps

- Use a VPN on all public Wi-Fi networks
- Verify network names with staff before connecting
- Keep your operating system and apps updated
- Use antivirus software on all devices
- Enable two-factor authentication on all accounts

## The Scam Lifecycle: How It All Connects

Here is how these sources typically work together in a real scam:

1. **Data broker purchase**: Scammer buys a list of 10,000 people over age 65 with their names, phone numbers, and addresses for a few hundred dollars
2. **Breach data enrichment**: Cross-references the list with leaked email/password databases
3. **Social media research**: Checks Facebook profiles for family photos and life events
4. **Targeted attack**: Calls the target, references their grandchild by name, claims the grandchild is in trouble and needs bail money wired immediately

This is not hypothetical. The FTC reports that impostor scams cost Americans over $2.7 billion in 2023 alone, and the median loss for phone-based scams was $1,480.

### The Economics of Scamming

Understanding the economics helps explain why scams are so persistent:

- **Cost to acquire 10,000 phone records from data brokers**: $50-500
- **Cost of VoIP calling software to dial all 10,000**: $50/month
- **Success rate for phone scams**: Approximately 1-3%
- **Average take per successful scam**: $500-5,000
- **ROI for the scammer**: Even at 1% success, 100 victims x $500 = $50,000 on a $500 investment

The data broker industry is the engine that makes this math work. Without cheap, bulk access to personal phone numbers and biographical details, the cost of targeting individuals would be prohibitively high for most scam operations.

### Why Scams Keep Getting More Convincing

Scams evolve because the data available to scammers keeps improving. Ten years ago, a scammer might have had your name and phone number. Today, a data broker profile can include your age, estimated income, political affiliation, health interests, recent purchases, and family members' names. AI voice cloning tools can now replicate a family member's voice from a few seconds of social media audio. The more data available, the more convincing the scam.

## How to Protect Yourself: A Complete Checklist

### Immediate Actions

- [ ] Freeze your credit at all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
- [ ] Enable two-factor authentication on email, banking, and social media
- [ ] Check HaveIBeenPwned.com for breach exposure
- [ ] Set social media profiles to private
- [ ] Opt out of pre-approved credit offers

### Ongoing Protection

- [ ] Use a password manager with unique passwords for every account
- [ ] Monitor your credit reports quarterly
- [ ] Shred physical documents before discarding
- [ ] Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi
- [ ] Remove your information from data brokers

### The Data Broker Problem

You can manually opt out of data brokers one by one, but there are over 4,000 of them, and many re-list your information within months. The average person would need to submit over 200 individual opt-out requests and repeat the process several times per year.

GhostMyData automates this entire process. We continuously scan [2,100+ data broker databases](/how-it-works), submit opt-out requests on your behalf, and monitor for re-listings. [See our pricing plans](/pricing) or [start with a free scan](/register) to see where your data is currently exposed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do scammers get my phone number?

The most common source is data brokers, which aggregate phone numbers from public records, commercial databases, app permissions, and online forms. Your phone number is likely listed on dozens of people-search sites right now. Data breaches and social media profiles are secondary sources.

### Can scammers do anything with just my name and address?

Yes. With your name and address, scammers can search data brokers for additional information, send you phishing mail that appears to be from your local government, file change-of-address forms to redirect your mail, and use the information for identity verification challenges.

### How do I know if my information is on data broker sites?

You can search for yourself on sites like Spokeo, BeenVerified, and Whitepages, or [run a free scan with GhostMyData](/register) to check 2,100+ data broker databases at once.

### What is the most effective way to stop scammers from getting my data?

The most effective single action is removing yourself from data brokers, since they are the primary aggregation point that feeds all other scam channels. Combined with a credit freeze, strong passwords, and two-factor authentication, this dramatically reduces your attack surface.

### Are data brokers legal?

Most data brokers operate legally under current US law. However, regulations are tightening. California's CCPA (Section 1798.99.80) requires data brokers to register with the state and honor deletion requests. The EU's GDPR Article 17 provides a "right to erasure" that applies to any company processing EU residents' data.

## What Is the California DROP System?

DROP, the Delete Request and Opt-Out Platform, is a free online tool being built by the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) under the authority of SB 362, also known as the DELETE Act. When it launches on August 1, 2026, it will allow California residents to submit a single deletion request that reaches every data broker registered with the state.

This is the first government-operated data deletion platform in the United States, and it represents a major shift in how consumers can exercise their privacy rights.

## The DELETE Act (SB 362): What the Law Actually Says

SB 362, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on October 10, 2023, amended the California Civil Code to add several critical requirements:

### Key Provisions

- **Section 1798.99.82(a)**: The CPPA must establish an "accessible deletion mechanism" allowing consumers to request deletion from all registered data brokers through a single verifiable request.
- **Section 1798.99.82(b)**: Data brokers must process deletion requests received through the mechanism within 31 business days (approximately 45 calendar days).
- **Section 1798.99.80(d)**: Data brokers must register with the CPPA annually and pay a registration fee. Failure to register carries fines of $200 per day.
- **Section 1798.99.82(d)**: Every 45 days after the initial deletion, registered data brokers must delete any newly acquired personal information about the consumer, unless the consumer revokes the request.

That last provision is critical. DROP is not a one-time deletion. It creates an ongoing obligation for data brokers to keep deleting your data every 45 days for as long as you maintain your request.

## How DROP Will Work

Based on the CPPA's published rulemaking documents and public board meetings, here is what we know about how the platform will function:

### Step 1: Identity Verification

You will need to verify your identity as a California resident. The CPPA has indicated this will likely involve:

- A valid California ID or driver's license
- Proof of California residency (utility bill, lease agreement, or voter registration)
- Possibly integration with California's existing digital identity infrastructure

### Step 2: Submit a Deletion Request

Once verified, you submit a single request through the DROP portal. This request is transmitted to every data broker currently registered with the state.

### Step 3: Broker Processing

Each registered data broker has 31 business days to process your deletion request. They must:

- Search their databases for your personal information
- Delete all personal information they hold about you
- Confirm deletion to the CPPA

### Step 4: Ongoing Protection

After the initial deletion, brokers must check for and delete any newly collected information about you every 45 days. This continues indefinitely unless you revoke your request.

## Who DROP Covers (and Who It Does Not)

### Covered: Registered California Data Brokers

As of early 2026, approximately 530 data brokers are registered with the CPPA. These include major people-search sites and data aggregators:

- Acxiom (now Liveramp)
- CoreLogic
- Epsilon Data Management
- LexisNexis Risk Solutions
- Spokeo
- BeenVerified
- Whitepages (Marchex)
- Intelius
- PeopleFinder

### NOT Covered: Several Important Categories

DROP has significant limitations that consumers need to understand:

**1. Unregistered data brokers.** Any data broker that fails to register with the CPPA is technically in violation of the law, but their absence from the registry means DROP requests will not reach them. Research suggests hundreds of data brokers operating in the US have not registered.

**2. Companies that do not meet California's data broker definition.** Under Section 1798.99.80(d), a "data broker" is defined as a business that "knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship." Companies that have a direct relationship with you (your bank, employer, social media platform) are excluded.

**3. Data brokers outside California's jurisdiction.** Companies operating entirely outside the US or without sufficient California contacts may not comply.

**4. AI training data companies.** Many AI companies that have scraped personal data for training purposes may not meet the technical definition of "data broker" under California law, though this is an evolving area of litigation.

**5. Data already sold before deletion.** DROP requires deletion from the broker's systems, but it does not claw back data that has already been sold to third parties. If your information was sold to a marketing firm last month, that copy persists.

## DROP vs. Manual Opt-Outs vs. Automated Services

### Manual Opt-Out

Opting out of data brokers individually is free but extraordinarily time-consuming:

- **Time required**: Research by Incogni estimates it takes over 304 hours to manually opt out of all known data brokers
- **Brokers covered**: Limited to however many you can find and submit to
- **Ongoing protection**: None. You must repeat the process every few months
- **Success rate**: Variable. Some brokers make opt-out deliberately difficult

### California DROP

- **Time required**: Minutes (single request)
- **Brokers covered**: Only the ~530 registered with California
- **Ongoing protection**: Yes, every 45 days (for registered brokers only)
- **Limitations**: California residents only; does not cover unregistered brokers, non-broker data holders, or data already sold

### Automated Services (GhostMyData, etc.)

- **Time required**: Minutes (sign up and scan)
- **Brokers covered**: GhostMyData covers 2,100+ data sources, including brokers outside California's registry
- **Ongoing protection**: Continuous monitoring and re-removal
- **Additional features**: Dark web monitoring, privacy score, removal verification, [detailed progress tracking](/how-it-works)

## Why DROP Is Not Enough by Itself

DROP is a significant step forward for consumer privacy, but treating it as a complete solution would be a mistake. Here is why:

### The Registration Gap

California's registry has approximately 530 data brokers. Independent research has identified over 4,000 data broker companies operating in the US. That means DROP covers roughly 13% of known data brokers.

Many of the most problematic data brokers, particularly smaller people-search sites and fly-by-night operations, have not registered and may never register. These are often the sites that appear first in Google searches for someone's name.

### Geographic Limitations

DROP is available only to California residents. If you live in any other state, you have no access to the platform. While other states are considering similar legislation (Texas and Oregon have passed data broker registration requirements), no other state has built a centralized deletion platform.

### The 45-Day Window

Even for registered brokers, there is a 45-day gap between deletion cycles. During that window, a broker can collect and use your personal information before the next deletion sweep. For someone actively being stalked, harassed, or targeted by scammers, 45 days is a dangerously long exposure window.

### No Enforcement Track Record

As of early 2026, the CPPA has not yet demonstrated significant enforcement action against non-compliant data brokers. The penalties exist on paper ($200/day for failure to register, plus CCPA enforcement), but the agency's enforcement capacity and willingness to pursue violators remains untested.

## How DROP Interacts with Existing Privacy Laws

### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)

DROP builds on the foundation of the CCPA, which already grants California residents the right to:

- Know what personal information a business collects (Section 1798.100)
- Delete personal information (Section 1798.105)
- Opt out of the sale of personal information (Section 1798.120)
- Non-discrimination for exercising privacy rights (Section 1798.125)

DROP essentially automates the deletion right for data brokers specifically, making it practical for consumers to exercise a right that was previously too burdensome.

### GDPR (for comparison)

The EU's General Data Protection Regulation provides broader protections under Article 17 (Right to Erasure), which applies to any data controller, not just data brokers. GDPR also requires affirmative consent for data collection in most cases, a standard US law has not adopted. Europeans already have stronger baseline protections, though enforcement varies by member state.

### Other State Laws

Several states have enacted or are considering data broker legislation:

- **Vermont**: First state to require data broker registration (2018)
- **Texas**: Data broker registration law passed in 2023
- **Oregon**: Data broker registration and consumer deletion rights (2024)
- **New Jersey**: Consumer data privacy act with data broker provisions (2024)

None of these states have built a DROP-equivalent centralized platform.

## The Political and Industry Landscape

### Industry Opposition

The data broker industry has lobbied aggressively against the DELETE Act and DROP. The Data & Marketing Association (now the Association of National Advertisers) submitted formal opposition during SB 362's legislative process, arguing that the bill would impose undue compliance costs and disrupt legitimate data-driven marketing.

Industry lobbying efforts have focused on:

- Narrowing the definition of "data broker" to exclude as many companies as possible
- Extending compliance timelines beyond the 31-business-day requirement
- Weakening the ongoing 45-day deletion obligation
- Arguing that federal preemption should override state-level privacy laws

### Consumer Advocacy Support

Privacy organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Consumer Reports, and the California Privacy Rights Advocates have strongly supported DROP. Their advocacy emphasizes that:

- Consumers currently bear a disproportionate burden in exercising their deletion rights
- The estimated 300+ hours required for manual opt-out across all brokers is an unreasonable barrier
- A centralized mechanism is the only practical way to make deletion rights meaningful
- California's approach could serve as a model for federal privacy legislation

### What This Means for Federal Privacy Law

The American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA) has been proposed at the federal level but has not passed as of early 2026. If federal legislation eventually passes, it may include a national equivalent of DROP. Until then, California's implementation will serve as the test case that either validates or exposes the challenges of government-operated deletion platforms.

## What You Should Do Before DROP Launches

### If You Are a California Resident

1. **Do not wait until August 2026.** Your data is being sold and used right now. Take action today.
2. **Start removing yourself from data brokers now.** Use GhostMyData to [scan and remove your data from 2,100+ sources](/register), including all of the brokers in California's registry and thousands more.
3. **Plan to use DROP as a supplement, not a replacement.** When DROP launches, use it for the ongoing 45-day deletion cycle, but maintain an automated service for the 1,500+ brokers DROP does not cover.
4. **Freeze your credit** at Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

### If You Live Outside California

1. **You cannot use DROP** (at least not yet). Contact your state representatives and advocate for similar legislation.
2. **Use your existing rights.** Many data brokers honor CCPA deletion requests from all US residents, even though they are only legally required to honor California residents' requests.
3. **Use an automated removal service.** GhostMyData works for residents of all 50 states and covers brokers nationwide. [See our pricing](/pricing) and [how it works](/how-it-works).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When does DROP launch?

The DELETE Act requires the CPPA to have the DROP platform operational by August 1, 2026. The CPPA has been conducting rulemaking proceedings throughout 2025 and early 2026 to define the platform's requirements.

### Is DROP free to use?

Yes. DROP is a free government service funded by data broker registration fees. There is no cost to consumers.

### Do I need to be a California resident?

Yes. DROP is available only to verified California residents. There is currently no federal equivalent, though legislation has been proposed.

### Will DROP delete my data from Google?

No. Google is not a data broker under California's definition because it has a direct relationship with its users. However, Google does offer a "Results About You" tool that allows you to request removal of personal information from search results.

### How is DROP different from GhostMyData?

DROP covers approximately 530 registered California data brokers with 45-day deletion cycles. GhostMyData covers 2,100+ data sources nationwide with continuous monitoring and immediate re-removal. DROP is free and government-operated; GhostMyData is a paid service with broader coverage and faster response times. The two are complementary, not competing.

### What if a data broker ignores my DROP request?

The CPPA has enforcement authority to fine non-compliant data brokers. If a registered broker fails to process a DROP deletion request within 31 business days, you can file a complaint with the CPPA. Penalties can include administrative fines and CCPA enforcement actions.

### Does DROP cover data that has already been sold?

No. DROP requires data brokers to delete your information from their own systems, but it does not affect copies that have already been transmitted to third-party purchasers. This is one reason ongoing protection through a service like GhostMyData is important: your data is continuously recollected and resold.

## The AI Training Data Problem You Did Not Consent To

Large language models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Meta AI were trained on massive datasets scraped from the internet. That includes personal information: your name, your social media posts, your forum comments, your published work, and in many cases, your private data purchased or scraped from data brokers.

A 2023 study by researchers at ETH Zurich found that GPT-3.5 could accurately recall personal email addresses for over 80% of tested subjects. A separate study by UC Berkeley demonstrated that language models can be prompted to reveal training data including phone numbers, addresses, and social media handles.

You did not consent to this. But you do have options.

## Your Legal Rights Regarding AI Training Data

### GDPR Article 17: Right to Erasure

If you are an EU/EEA resident or if an AI company processes your data in the EU, GDPR Article 17 gives you the right to have your personal data erased. This applies to AI training data, though enforcement is still evolving.

Key provisions:

- **Article 17(1)(b)**: You can withdraw consent and request erasure if there is no other legal basis for processing
- **Article 17(1)(d)**: Data that has been unlawfully processed must be erased
- **Article 6(1)(f)**: Companies often claim "legitimate interest" as a basis for training, but this can be challenged

The Italian data protection authority (Garante) temporarily banned ChatGPT in 2023 over GDPR violations, and OpenAI subsequently added opt-out mechanisms for European users.

### CCPA Section 1798.105: Right to Delete

California residents can request deletion of personal information held by businesses, including AI companies. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act:

- You have the right to request deletion of your personal information
- Businesses must comply within 45 calendar days
- This right extends to information used for AI model training, though the practical implementation is complex

### The "Unlearning" Problem

A critical technical challenge exists: once personal data has been used to train a model, it is extremely difficult to truly "remove" that data from the model's weights. Companies typically address deletion requests by:

1. Removing the data from future training datasets
2. Filtering the data from model outputs
3. Fine-tuning models to reduce the likelihood of reproducing the data

True "machine unlearning" is an active area of research but is not yet practical at scale. This means that exercising your opt-out rights today primarily prevents your data from being used in future training runs and reduces its appearance in model outputs.

## How to Opt Out: Company by Company

### OpenAI (ChatGPT, DALL-E, GPT-4)

**Step 1: Disable Chat History Training**

1. Log in to ChatGPT at chat.openai.com
2. Click your profile icon in the bottom left
3. Go to Settings > Data Controls
4. Toggle off "Improve the model for everyone"
5. Note: This prevents future conversations from being used for training. Past conversations may have already been used.

**Step 2: Submit a Data Deletion Request**

1. Visit [privacy.openai.com](https://privacy.openai.com)
2. Click "Make a Privacy Request"
3. Select "Delete my personal information from OpenAI's training data"
4. Provide your information so they can locate your data
5. Submit the request

**Step 3: Opt Out of Web Scraping (for website owners)**

Add the following to your site's robots.txt file:

\`\`\`
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Disallow: /
\`\`\`

**Response time**: OpenAI states they will respond within 30 days (45 days for CCPA requests).

### Google (Gemini, Bard, Search Generative Experience)

**Step 1: Manage Gemini Activity**

1. Go to myactivity.google.com
2. Select "Gemini Apps" from the left sidebar
3. Click "Turn off" to stop saving Gemini activity
4. Delete existing activity by clicking "Delete" and selecting "All time"

**Step 2: Opt Out of AI Training**

1. Visit Google's Privacy Hub at myaccount.google.com/privacy
2. Navigate to "Data & Privacy" > "History Settings"
3. Turn off "Web & App Activity" for Gemini
4. For broader AI training opt-out, use Google's data deletion form at support.google.com/accounts/troubleshooter/6358155

**Step 3: Block Google-Extended (for website owners)**

Add to your robots.txt:

\`\`\`
User-agent: Google-Extended
Disallow: /
\`\`\`

This blocks Google from using your website content for AI training while preserving regular search indexing.

### Meta AI (LLaMA, Meta AI Assistant)

**Step 1: Opt Out of AI Training on Facebook/Instagram**

1. Open Facebook or Instagram
2. Go to Settings > Privacy > "AI at Meta"
3. Look for "Generative AI Data Subject Rights"
4. Select your country/region and submit an objection form
5. Explain that you object to your data being used for AI training

**Step 2: Submit a Formal Objection (EU/UK residents)**

1. Visit Meta's "Your Information and AI at Meta" page
2. Submit a Right to Object form under GDPR Article 21
3. Meta is legally required to respond within 30 days

**Important note**: Meta's opt-out process has been criticized by European regulators for being unnecessarily complex. If your initial request is denied, escalate by filing a complaint with your national data protection authority.

### Anthropic (Claude)

1. Visit anthropic.com/privacy
2. Anthropic states that conversations with Claude are not used to train models by default for API customers
3. For consumer Claude.ai users, prompts may be used for safety research but can be opted out via Settings
4. To request deletion of personal data, email privacy@anthropic.com with your request

### Microsoft (Copilot, Bing AI)

**Step 1: Manage Copilot Data**

1. Go to account.microsoft.com/privacy
2. Navigate to "Activity History"
3. Clear your Copilot conversation history
4. Under Privacy settings, review and limit data sharing

**Step 2: Submit a GDPR/CCPA Request**

1. Visit microsoft.com/en-us/concern/privacy
2. Select "Privacy" as your concern category
3. Submit a data deletion request specifying AI training data

**Step 3: Block AI Crawling (for website owners)**

\`\`\`
User-agent: Bingbot
Disallow: /ai-training/
\`\`\`

Note: Blocking Bingbot entirely will remove your site from Bing search results. Microsoft does not currently offer a separate AI-specific crawler user agent.

## The Hidden Pipeline: How Data Brokers Feed AI Training

While direct opt-outs from AI companies are important, they address only one part of the problem. A significant portion of AI training data comes not from direct web scraping but from data brokers and aggregated datasets.

### How the Pipeline Works

1. **Data brokers collect your information** from public records, social media, commercial transactions, and other sources
2. **Brokers sell aggregated datasets** to AI companies, research institutions, and data resellers
3. **Datasets are incorporated into training corpora** alongside web-scraped data
4. **AI models learn patterns** from this data, including personal information
5. **Models can reproduce personal information** when prompted in certain ways

### The Common Crawl Connection

Most major AI models were trained at least partially on Common Crawl, a nonprofit that has been archiving the web since 2011. Common Crawl's dataset includes snapshots of data broker websites, people-search results, and other pages containing personal information.

When you search for your name on Spokeo or BeenVerified, that search results page may end up in Common Crawl's archive and subsequently in AI training datasets. This means your data broker profiles are likely embedded in multiple AI models.

### Breaking the Pipeline at the Source

The most effective way to prevent your data from entering AI training pipelines is to remove it from data brokers. When your information is no longer published on data broker websites:

- Future web crawls will not capture it
- Future Common Crawl archives will not include it
- Future AI training datasets built from web data will not contain it

This is why data broker removal is not just about privacy from people-search sites. It is about cutting off the supply chain that feeds your personal data into AI systems, advertising networks, scam operations, and more.

[GhostMyData removes your data from 2,100+ data broker sources](/how-it-works), including the people-search sites and data aggregators most commonly scraped for AI training data.

## What AI Companies Know About You (And How to Find Out)

### Subject Access Requests

Under both GDPR (Article 15) and CCPA (Section 1798.110), you have the right to request a copy of all personal information a company holds about you. This includes information used for AI training.

**How to submit a Subject Access Request:**

1. Identify the AI company's privacy contact (usually found in their privacy policy)
2. Send a written request specifying that you want all personal information held, including training data
3. Include enough identifying information for them to locate your data
4. Reference the specific legal basis (GDPR Article 15 or CCPA Section 1798.110)
5. The company must respond within 30 days (GDPR) or 45 days (CCPA)

### What You Will Likely Receive

In practice, AI companies typically respond to subject access requests with:

- A copy of your account data and conversation history
- A statement about whether your data was included in training datasets
- A list of data sources used for training (in general terms)
- An explanation of how to opt out of future training

They will not provide a specific extract of "your data" from within the model, because that is not technically feasible with current architectures.

## A Practical AI Privacy Action Plan

### Priority 1: Stop the Bleeding

- [ ] Opt out of AI training on all platforms you use (OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft)
- [ ] Disable chat history training on ChatGPT and similar tools
- [ ] Review and delete stored AI conversation histories

### Priority 2: Block Future Collection

- [ ] Add robots.txt rules blocking AI crawlers on any websites you operate
- [ ] Remove personal information from data broker sites that feed AI training pipelines
- [ ] [Start a free GhostMyData scan](/register) to identify and remove data broker exposures

### Priority 3: Exercise Your Legal Rights

- [ ] Submit data deletion requests to AI companies holding your data
- [ ] File Subject Access Requests to understand what data is held
- [ ] If in the EU, consider filing complaints with your data protection authority for non-compliance

### Priority 4: Ongoing Protection

- [ ] Monitor for re-listing on data broker sites (automated services handle this)
- [ ] Stay informed about AI privacy legislation in your jurisdiction
- [ ] Review AI companies' privacy policies when they update (they change frequently)
- [ ] [Compare automated data removal services](/compare) for continuous protection

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can AI companies really delete my data from their models?

Not in the traditional sense. Once data has been used to train a model, it becomes embedded in the model's mathematical weights and cannot be surgically removed. However, companies can remove your data from future training datasets, filter outputs to prevent your information from appearing, and apply fine-tuning to reduce memorization of your data.

### Is it legal for AI companies to use my personal data for training?

This is an active legal question. In the EU, several data protection authorities have found that AI training on personal data without consent violates GDPR. In the US, the legal landscape is less clear, but CCPA deletion rights apply to AI training data. Multiple class-action lawsuits are pending against major AI companies.

### Does opting out of ChatGPT training affect past conversations?

No. Disabling "Improve the model for everyone" in ChatGPT settings only affects future conversations. Past conversations may have already been used for training. To address past data, you need to submit a separate data deletion request through OpenAI's privacy portal.

### How do data brokers feed AI training?

Data brokers publish personal information on people-search websites that are indexed by web crawlers. These crawled pages end up in datasets like Common Crawl, which are used by AI companies for training. Additionally, some AI companies purchase datasets directly from data brokers or data aggregators.

### Will removing my data from brokers remove it from AI models?

It will not remove data that has already been used for training, but it prevents your data from appearing in future training datasets built from web-scraped data. Over time, as models are retrained on newer data, the persistence of your personal information in AI outputs should decrease.

### What about AI-generated images of me?

If AI models can generate images of you (typically this affects public figures), you can submit removal requests to the specific AI image generation service. GDPR Article 17 and CCPA Section 1798.105 apply to biometric data and likeness. Some states also have specific laws protecting likeness rights.

## Your Phone Number Is More Dangerous Than Your Social Security Number

That sounds hyperbolic, but consider this: your Social Security number is supposed to be private. Your phone number, on the other hand, is tied to your identity, your location, your bank accounts, your two-factor authentication, and it is almost certainly publicly searchable on dozens of data broker websites right now.

The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported over 2,000 SIM swapping complaints in 2022 alone, with losses exceeding $72 million. And SIM swapping is just one of the threats. Your phone number is a skeleton key that can unlock far more than most people realize.

## 8 Things Someone Can Do with Your Phone Number

### 1. SIM Swapping: Hijacking Your Phone Number

SIM swapping (also called SIM jacking) is the most dangerous phone number attack. Here is how it works:

1. The attacker gathers your personal information (name, address, last four digits of SSN) from data brokers or social engineering
2. They call your mobile carrier, impersonate you, and claim they need a new SIM card
3. The carrier transfers your phone number to the attacker's SIM card
4. Your phone loses service. The attacker now receives all your calls and texts
5. They use SMS-based two-factor authentication to access your email, bank accounts, and cryptocurrency wallets

**Real-world impact**: In January 2024, the SEC's official X (Twitter) account was compromised via a SIM swap attack, leading to a fake announcement about Bitcoin ETF approval that briefly moved markets. Individual victims have reported losses of $10,000 to $20 million in cryptocurrency theft via SIM swapping.

### 2. Two-Factor Authentication Bypass

Most online services offer SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA). If someone has your phone number and can intercept your texts (via SIM swapping, SS7 attacks, or social engineering your carrier), they can bypass 2FA on:

- Email accounts (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)
- Banking and financial apps
- Social media accounts
- Cryptocurrency exchanges
- Cloud storage services

This is why security experts recommend app-based authenticators (Google Authenticator, Authy) or hardware keys (YubiKey) over SMS-based 2FA.

### 3. Social Engineering and Pretexting

With your phone number and the personal information data brokers provide alongside it, an attacker can:

- **Call your bank** pretending to be you and pass phone-based identity verification
- **Contact your employer** posing as a family member in an "emergency"
- **Call your elderly parents** claiming to be a grandchild in trouble
- **Reach out to your contacts** from a spoofed number that displays your caller ID

The FCC estimated that Americans received approximately 50 billion robocalls in 2023. Many of these calls use personal information sourced from data brokers to make the scam more convincing.

### 4. Account Discovery and Takeover

Your phone number is a universal identifier across services. A determined attacker can:

- **Use password reset flows** on websites that accept phone-based recovery to discover which services you use
- **Cross-reference leaked databases** where your phone number appears alongside other credentials
- **Search social media platforms** where your phone number is linked to your account (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal all use phone numbers as identifiers)

### 5. Location Tracking

Your phone number can reveal your physical location through several mechanisms:

- **SS7 vulnerabilities**: The Signaling System 7 protocol that connects cell networks worldwide has known vulnerabilities that allow tracking a phone's location to within a few hundred meters. While exploiting SS7 requires specialized access, this capability is sold by surveillance companies to governments and, occasionally, to private parties.
- **Carrier lookup services**: Legitimate services used by businesses to identify carrier information can reveal your general geographic area.
- **Social engineering carriers**: An attacker posing as you can request location services or account details from your carrier.
- **Data broker profiles**: People-search sites associate phone numbers with physical addresses, providing a current or recent home location.

### 6. Spam Calls, Robocalls, and Phone Scams

Once your phone number enters the data broker ecosystem, it is sold and resold thousands of times. The result:

- **Billions of robocalls annually**: The FCC receives over 200,000 unwanted call complaints per year, but the actual volume is estimated at 50+ billion calls
- **Targeted scam calls**: Scammers use data broker information to personalize calls, referencing your name, address, or recent activity
- **Neighbor spoofing**: Calls that appear to come from your area code and prefix, making them seem local and trustworthy

### 7. Harassment and Stalking

A phone number is one of the most sought-after pieces of information for stalkers and harassers:

- **Direct contact**: Unwanted calls and threatening text messages
- **Doxxing**: Publishing your phone number alongside your name and address online
- **Swatting**: Making false emergency reports tied to the phone number's registered address
- **Signing up for unwanted services**: Subscribing your number to spam services, religious organizations, or controversial political groups

### 8. Identity Verification Exploitation

Many services use phone numbers for identity verification. An attacker with your number can:

- **Port your number** to a new carrier (a form of SIM swapping)
- **Verify new accounts** using your number during the window between SIM swap and detection
- **Access voicemail** (many carriers use the last four digits of your phone number as the default PIN)
- **Exploit "verify via call" systems** that read a code aloud to the person who answers

## How Your Phone Number Becomes Public

Most people do not realize how widely their phone number is distributed:

### Data Brokers

This is the primary distribution channel. Data brokers collect phone numbers from:

- **Public records** (property records, voter registration, court filings)
- **Commercial databases** (loyalty programs, warranty registrations, online purchases)
- **App permissions** (apps that request access to your contacts upload entire address books)
- **Telecom records** (carrier data sold to aggregators)
- **Social media** (phone numbers added for security or contact purposes)

A single phone number typically appears on 20-50 data broker sites. Each of these sites is publicly searchable, meaning anyone who knows your name can find your phone number, and anyone who has your phone number can find your name and address.

### Data Breaches

Phone numbers are included in most data breaches. When a company's database is breached, the stolen data typically includes names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses. This data ends up on dark web marketplaces within days.

### Your Own Actions

You unknowingly share your phone number more than you think:

- Business cards and email signatures
- Online forms and registrations
- Social media profiles
- Contest entries and warranty cards
- Real estate transactions
- Court filings and legal proceedings

## How to Make Your Phone Number Unsearchable

### Step 1: Remove Your Number from Data Brokers

This is the single most impactful step. As long as your phone number is listed on data broker sites, it is publicly searchable and will be sold to new buyers continuously.

**Manual approach**: Search for your phone number on sites like Spokeo, BeenVerified, Whitepages, TruePeopleSearch, FastPeopleSearch, and others. Submit individual opt-out requests to each site. Repeat every 3-6 months as your information gets re-listed.

**Automated approach**: [GhostMyData scans 2,100+ data broker sources](/how-it-works) for your phone number and submits removal requests automatically, with continuous monitoring for re-listings. [Start with a free scan](/register) to see where your number currently appears.

### Step 2: Protect Your Carrier Account

- **Set a carrier PIN or passcode**: Call your carrier (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc.) and set up a port-out PIN. This prevents SIM swapping without the PIN.
- **AT&T**: Use the myAT&T app or call 611 to set up a passcode
- **T-Mobile**: Enable "Account Takeover Protection" in your account settings
- **Verizon**: Set up a "Number Lock" in the My Verizon app
- **Enable SIM lock**: Some carriers offer the ability to lock your SIM card, preventing it from being transferred

### Step 3: Switch to App-Based 2FA

Replace SMS-based 2FA with app-based authentication wherever possible:

- **Google Authenticator** or **Microsoft Authenticator** for most services
- **Authy** for cloud-backed codes across devices
- **Hardware security keys** (YubiKey, Google Titan) for highest security
- Update 2FA on your email, banking, social media, and cryptocurrency accounts first

### Step 4: Use a Secondary Number

Consider using a VoIP or secondary number for public-facing activities:

- **Google Voice**: Free, provides a separate number for online forms and businesses
- **Burner apps**: Disposable numbers for Craigslist, dating apps, and temporary uses
- **Business line**: Keep your personal number off business cards and websites

### Step 5: Register with the Do Not Call Registry

Visit DoNotCall.gov to register your number. While this does not stop scammers (who ignore the registry), it does reduce legitimate telemarketing calls. Registration is free and does not expire.

### Step 6: Audit and Minimize Exposure

- Remove your phone number from social media profiles
- Do not use your primary phone number for online shopping accounts
- Never enter your real phone number on sweepstakes, quizzes, or "free offer" forms
- Check app permissions and revoke contact access for apps that do not need it

## What to Do If Your Number Is Already Compromised

### If You Suspect a SIM Swap

1. **Contact your carrier immediately** (from a different phone) and report the unauthorized port
2. **Change passwords** on all critical accounts (email first, then banking, then social media)
3. **Check financial accounts** for unauthorized transactions
4. **File a report** with the FBI's IC3 at ic3.gov
5. **Freeze your credit** at all three bureaus
6. **Contact your bank** and flag your accounts for potential fraud

### If You Are Receiving Threatening Calls

1. **Document everything**: Save voicemails, screenshot text messages, note call times and numbers
2. **Report to police**: Especially if threats include violence, stalking, or extortion
3. **Report to the FCC**: File a complaint at fcc.gov/consumers/guides/report-unwanted-calls
4. **Block the numbers**: Use your phone's built-in blocking features
5. **Consider changing your number**: As a last resort, get a new number and be careful about where you share it

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can someone hack my bank account with just my phone number?

Not with the phone number alone, but it is a critical piece of the puzzle. Combined with other personal information (which is readily available from data brokers), an attacker can use your phone number for SIM swapping, which then provides access to SMS-based two-factor authentication codes for your bank.

### Should I change my phone number if it is on data broker sites?

Changing your number is a last resort because it creates significant inconvenience. A more practical approach is to remove your current number from data broker sites using an automated service, set up carrier protections (port-out PIN, account takeover protection), and use a secondary number for public-facing activities going forward.

### How do I find out which data broker sites have my phone number?

You can search for your phone number manually on major people-search sites like Spokeo, Whitepages, and BeenVerified. However, this only covers a fraction of the data brokers that may have your information. [A free GhostMyData scan](/register) checks 2,100+ data sources simultaneously.

### Is the Do Not Call Registry effective against scammers?

No. The National Do Not Call Registry reduces legitimate telemarketing calls, but scammers and robocallers ignore it entirely. The registry has no mechanism to prevent or penalize illegal callers, particularly those operating from overseas. Removing your number from data brokers is more effective because it cuts off the supply of numbers that scammers purchase.

### Can someone track my location with just my phone number?

In theory, yes. SS7 protocol vulnerabilities allow location tracking of any phone number, and this capability is sold by surveillance companies. In practice, this type of tracking requires specialized access and is primarily used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. However, data broker profiles that associate your phone number with your home address provide a simpler form of location information to anyone who searches.

### What is the best way to protect my phone number going forward?

The most effective combination is: (1) remove your number from data broker sites, (2) set up a port-out PIN with your carrier, (3) switch to app-based 2FA instead of SMS, (4) use a secondary number for non-essential services, and (5) maintain ongoing monitoring for re-listing on data broker sites.

## Why Your iPhone Won't Stop Ringing

If your iPhone is flooded with spam calls, you are not alone. The FCC estimates that Americans receive approximately 50 billion robocalls per year, roughly 150 calls per person. Spam calls are the single most common consumer complaint to the FCC, and the problem continues to grow despite regulatory efforts.

The reason is straightforward: your phone number is being bought and sold by data brokers. These companies collect your number from public records, online forms, app permissions, and commercial databases, then sell it in bulk to telemarketers, lead generators, and scammers. Every method in this guide will help reduce spam calls, but only one addresses the root cause.

Here are seven proven methods to stop spam calls on your iPhone, ordered from quick fixes to the permanent solution.

## Method 1: Silence Unknown Callers (Built-In)

Apple's "Silence Unknown Callers" feature is the fastest way to immediately reduce spam calls. It routes all calls from numbers not in your contacts, recent outgoing calls, or Siri suggestions directly to voicemail.

### How to Enable Silence Unknown Callers

1. Open **Settings** on your iPhone
2. Scroll down and tap **Phone**
3. Scroll to the "Call Silencing and Blocked Contacts" section
4. Tap **Silence Unknown Callers**
5. Toggle the switch to **On** (green)

### What Happens When It Is Enabled

- Calls from unknown numbers go directly to voicemail without ringing
- The call still appears in your Recent calls list
- The caller can still leave a voicemail
- If someone calls you and you do not have their number, they will be silenced the first time but not the second time if you call them back (their number becomes a "recent outgoing call")

### Limitations

- **You will miss legitimate calls** from doctors' offices, delivery drivers, schools, and businesses calling from numbers not in your contacts
- **Does not block the calls**: Spammers still reach your voicemail, and your number remains in their databases
- **No filtering intelligence**: It blocks ALL unknown numbers, not just spam

### Best For

People who primarily communicate via text and rarely receive calls from unknown numbers. Not ideal if you are job hunting, expecting medical calls, or running a business.

## Method 2: Live Voicemail (iOS 17+)

If you use Silence Unknown Callers, Live Voicemail (introduced in iOS 17) makes it much more practical by showing you a real-time transcription of voicemails as they are being left.

### How to Use Live Voicemail

1. Enable **Silence Unknown Callers** (Method 1 above)
2. When an unknown caller is sent to voicemail, a notification appears showing the caller's name (if available) and a live transcription
3. Read the transcription as the caller speaks
4. If the call is legitimate, tap **Pick Up** to answer before they hang up
5. If it is spam, let it go to voicemail or tap **End** to disconnect

### How to Enable Live Voicemail

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Phone**
3. Tap **Live Voicemail**
4. Toggle to **On**

Note: Live Voicemail requires iOS 17 or later and is available in English (US) and English (Canada) at launch, with additional languages added in later updates.

## Method 3: Carrier Spam Protection Tools

All three major US carriers offer free spam call identification and blocking tools. These tools analyze call patterns and known scam numbers to identify and label or block spam calls before they reach you.

### AT&T: ActiveArmor (formerly AT&T Call Protect)

**Free version includes:**
- Automatic fraud call blocking
- Spam risk labels on suspicious calls
- Personal block list
- Spam call reporting

**How to set up:**
1. Download **AT&T ActiveArmor** from the App Store
2. Open the app and sign in with your AT&T account
3. Follow the setup prompts to enable automatic blocking
4. Customize your blocking preferences

**Advanced version ($3.99/month) adds:**
- Reverse number lookup
- Data breach notifications
- Identity monitoring

### T-Mobile: Scam Shield

**Free version includes:**
- Scam ID (labels likely scam calls)
- Scam Block (sends likely scam calls to voicemail)
- Caller ID for unknown numbers
- Report spam numbers

**How to set up:**
1. Download **T-Mobile Scam Shield** from the App Store
2. Sign in with your T-Mobile account
3. Toggle on "Scam Block" to automatically block identified scam calls
4. Enable "Caller ID" to see names for unknown numbers

**Premium version ($4/month) adds:**
- Category filtering (telemarketers, political, surveys)
- Voicemail-to-text
- Reverse number lookup

### Verizon: Call Filter

**Free version includes:**
- Spam detection and labels
- Spam filter (high-risk calls go to voicemail)
- Report spam numbers
- Personal block and allow lists

**How to set up:**
1. Download **Verizon Call Filter** from the App Store
2. Sign in with your Verizon account
3. Enable spam filtering in the app settings
4. Customize your filter level (Low, Medium, High)

**Plus version ($2.99/month) adds:**
- Caller ID for unknown numbers
- Personal spam and robocall risk meter
- Spam lookup tool

### Carrier Tool Limitations

- They primarily catch known scam numbers and patterns. New scam operations often slip through for days or weeks.
- They do not address the root cause: your phone number being sold by data brokers.
- Some legitimate calls may be incorrectly labeled as spam (false positives).

## Method 4: Register with the National Do Not Call Registry

The National Do Not Call Registry is a free service operated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that prohibits legitimate telemarketers from calling registered numbers.

### How to Register

1. Visit **donotcall.gov**
2. Click "Register Your Phone"
3. Enter your phone number
4. Enter your email address
5. Click "Register"
6. Verify by clicking the link in the confirmation email

### What You Need to Know

- **Registration is permanent** (it no longer expires after 5 years, as of 2008)
- Takes effect within **31 days** of registration
- **Free**: No cost to register or maintain
- Cover both cell phones and landlines

### What the DNC Registry Does NOT Do

This is critical: **the Do Not Call Registry does not stop scammers**. The registry only applies to legitimate businesses that follow the law. Illegal robocallers and overseas scam operations ignore the registry entirely.

The DNC Registry also does not apply to:
- Political calls and surveys
- Charitable solicitation calls
- Informational calls (appointment reminders, flight notifications)
- Calls from companies you have an existing business relationship with

### Is It Worth Registering?

Yes, but with realistic expectations. Registration will reduce legitimate telemarketing calls (car warranty offers from real companies, home improvement solicitations, etc.), but it will have zero impact on the illegal robocalls and scam calls that make up the majority of unwanted calls today.

## Method 5: Third-Party Call Blocking Apps

Several third-party apps provide more sophisticated spam call blocking than what Apple or the carriers offer.

### Recommended Apps

**Truecaller (Free with premium options)**
- Crowd-sourced spam number database (over 2 billion numbers)
- Caller ID for unknown numbers
- Automatic spam call blocking
- Works internationally
- Privacy concern: by using Truecaller, you contribute your contacts to their database

**Hiya (Free with premium options)**
- Spam identification and blocking
- Caller ID
- Reverse phone lookup
- Used by Samsung as their default spam protection
- Does not upload your contacts (unlike some competitors)

**Nomorobo (Free for VoIP, $1.99/month for mobile)**
- FTC award-winning robocall blocker
- Real-time call screening
- Focuses specifically on robocalls and telemarketers
- Simpler interface, fewer features

### How to Enable a Third-Party Call Blocker on iPhone

After installing your chosen app:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Phone**
3. Tap **Call Blocking & Identification**
4. Toggle on the installed app
5. If multiple apps are installed, arrange them in priority order

### Privacy Trade-Off

Most call blocking apps require access to your call data to function. Some, like Truecaller, upload your contacts to their servers to build their identification database. Read each app's privacy policy carefully and understand what data you are sharing.

## Method 6: Block Individual Numbers

For persistent callers, you can block specific numbers directly on your iPhone.

### How to Block a Number

**From the Phone app:**
1. Open the **Phone** app
2. Tap **Recents**
3. Tap the **info button** (circled "i") next to the number you want to block
4. Scroll down and tap **Block this Caller**
5. Tap **Block Contact** to confirm

**From Settings:**
1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Phone**
3. Tap **Blocked Contacts**
4. Tap **Add New** to add numbers manually

### Limitations

- **Spammers rotate numbers frequently**, so blocking individual numbers is like playing whack-a-mole
- iPhone has no hard limit on blocked numbers, but managing a large block list is impractical
- Spoofed numbers cannot be effectively blocked because the same scammer calls from different numbers each time

## Method 7: Remove Your Number from Data Brokers (The Permanent Fix)

Every method above treats symptoms. This method treats the disease.

Your phone number appears on dozens of data broker websites right now. These sites sell your number to telemarketers, lead generators, and scammers in bulk. As long as your number is in these databases, you will continue to receive spam calls no matter how many you block.

### Why This Is the Most Effective Method

When your phone number is removed from data broker databases:

- **Telemarketers can no longer purchase it** as part of targeted call lists
- **Scammers lose their primary source** of phone numbers to call
- **Your number stops propagating** through the data broker ecosystem
- **New spam calls decrease over time** as existing lists age out

Research by data privacy organizations has found that individuals who remove their information from data brokers experience a measurable reduction in spam calls within 30-60 days, with continued improvement over 3-6 months as old call lists are cycled out.

### How to Remove Your Number from Data Brokers

**Manual approach:**
1. Search for your phone number on major people-search sites: Spokeo, BeenVerified, Whitepages, TruePeopleSearch, FastPeopleSearch, Radaris, Intelius, and others
2. Submit opt-out requests on each site (each has a different process)
3. Wait for processing (24 hours to 6 weeks depending on the broker)
4. Verify removal by searching again
5. Repeat every 3-6 months as your information gets re-listed

**Estimated time**: 40-80 hours for initial removal across major brokers, plus ongoing maintenance.

**Automated approach:**
GhostMyData scans [2,100+ data broker databases](/how-it-works) for your phone number, name, and other personal information. We submit opt-out requests on your behalf and continuously monitor for re-listings. Most users see a noticeable reduction in spam calls within the first month.

## The Complete Anti-Spam Stack for iPhone

For maximum protection, combine these methods:

| Layer | Method | What It Stops |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Data broker removal | Prevents new spam at the source |
| 2 | Carrier spam tool | Blocks known scam patterns |
| 3 | Silence Unknown Callers + Live Voicemail | Catches everything else |
| 4 | Do Not Call Registry | Reduces legitimate telemarketing |
| 5 | Individual blocking | Handles persistent specific numbers |

Using all five layers together provides the most comprehensive spam call protection available on iPhone.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I still get spam calls after registering with the Do Not Call Registry?

The Do Not Call Registry only applies to legitimate businesses that follow the law. The vast majority of spam calls today come from illegal robocall operations, often based overseas, that ignore the registry entirely. The registry is worth maintaining for the legitimate telemarketing calls it does block, but it is not a solution for illegal robocalls.

### Does Silence Unknown Callers block all spam calls?

It silences (sends to voicemail) all calls from numbers not in your contacts, recent outgoing calls, or Siri suggestions. This catches most spam calls but also silences legitimate calls from unknown numbers. Use Live Voicemail (iOS 17+) to screen these calls in real time.

### How long does it take for spam calls to decrease after data broker removal?

Most users report a noticeable decrease within 30-60 days. The full effect takes 3-6 months because existing call lists that already contain your number need time to age out. Continuous monitoring prevents new re-listings from restarting the cycle.

### Can spam callers leave voicemails even if I use Silence Unknown Callers?

Yes. Silence Unknown Callers sends the call to voicemail, so callers can still leave messages. To prevent spam voicemails, some carriers offer a "spam filter" option that blocks identified spam calls before they reach voicemail.

### Is it worth paying for premium carrier spam protection?

For most people, the free versions of AT&T ActiveArmor, T-Mobile Scam Shield, or Verizon Call Filter are sufficient. The premium versions add caller ID and reverse lookup, which are useful but not essential. Your money is better spent on data broker removal, which addresses the root cause.

### Why do spam calls come from numbers with my area code?

This technique is called "neighbor spoofing." Scammers forge the caller ID to display a local number, making you more likely to answer. The actual call often originates from a VoIP service overseas. Blocking these individual numbers is ineffective because each call uses a different spoofed number.
