Dear Mr. Milford,

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. We acknowledge receipt of your communication dated February 3, 2026, regarding misdirected data deletion requests to Syndigo, PowerReviews, and 1WorldSync.

We have reviewed your request and have taken the following immediate actions:

## Actions Completed

1. **Removal from Data Broker Directory**
   PowerReviews has been removed from our internal data broker directory and will no longer receive automated deletion requests.

2. **Reclassification**
   Syndigo, PowerReviews, and 1WorldSync have been reclassified in our systems as Data Processors (not Data Brokers), with documentation noting their role under GDPR Articles 28 and 29.

3. **Blocklist Implementation**
   All three organizations have been added to a permanent blocklist that prevents any future automated privacy-related submissions to:
   - syndigo.com
   - powerreviews.com
   - 1worldsync.com

4. **System Safeguards**
   We have implemented technical controls to ensure that even if these domains are inadvertently added to any future data source lists, they will be automatically blocked from receiving any communications.

## Confirmation

We confirm that:
- No further automated deletion or opt-out requests will be sent to Syndigo, PowerReviews, or 1WorldSync
- These organizations have been permanently excluded from our removal automation systems
- The changes have been deployed to our production environment

We appreciate you taking the time to clarify your organizations' role as Data Processors. This feedback helps us improve our service and ensure we are directing requests to the appropriate Data Controllers.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
