7. Click **Save**

**STEP 3: Join Subreddits**
1. Search for each subreddit and click **Join**:
   - r/privacy (main target)
   - r/personalfinance
   - r/technology
   - r/cybersecurity
   - r/LifeProTips
   - r/Scams
   - r/Entrepreneur
   - r/smallbusiness
   - r/SaaS

**STEP 4: Build Karma (DO THIS FOR 2-3 DAYS FIRST)**
1. Browse your joined subreddits
2. Find posts where people ask about privacy, spam calls, data brokers
3. Leave helpful comments (NOT promotional)
4. Upvote good content
5. Build to 50-100 karma before any self-promotion

**Karma Building Comments (copy and adapt):**

For spam call threads:
```
"Data brokers are the source of most spam calls. Look into opting out from sites like Spokeo, WhitePages, and BeenVerified. There are services that automate this if you don't have time to do it manually."
```

For doxxing/privacy threads:
```
"I work in the privacy space - the best defense against doxxing is removing yourself from data broker sites. Most people are on 50+ without knowing it."
```

For "how do I protect my privacy" threads:
```
"Start with the big data brokers: Spokeo, WhitePages, BeenVerified, FastPeopleSearch, Radaris. Each has an opt-out process but they're all different. Takes about 2 hours per site if you do it manually."
```

For identity theft threads:
```
"After a breach, freeze your credit with all 3 bureaus (it's free). Then start opting out of data broker sites - that's how scammers get your info to begin with."
```

**STEP 5: First Post (ONLY after building karma)**
- Wait at least 1 week
- Only post in subreddits that allow self-promotion (check rules!)
- r/SaaS and r/Entrepreneur are more accepting
- Frame as "I built this" not "buy my product"

- [ ] Email verified

Subject: Would you hunt GhostMyData?

Hi [Name],

I've been following your hunts - loved [specific product they hunted].

I'm launching GhostMyData, a privacy tool that removes personal data from 400+ data broker sites automatically.

Would you be interested in hunting it? Happy to share early access and provide all assets.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Alternative:** Self-hunt (launch yourself as maker - less visibility but no hunter needed)

**STEP 6: Prepare Maker Comment (for launch day)**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built GhostMyData because I was shocked to find my personal data on 80+ data broker websites. Name, address, phone, relatives - all public and searchable.

Removing myself manually would have taken 100+ hours. So I built a tool to do it automatically.

What GhostMyData does:
🔍 Scans 400+ data broker sites
🗑️ Submits opt-out requests automatically
📸 Verifies each removal with screenshots
📊 Monitors weekly for new listings

We're 40% cheaper than competitors like DeleteMe ($11.99/mo vs $20+).

I'd love your feedback - and happy to answer any questions about privacy, data brokers, or the tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, Puppeteer).

```

SaaS/Launch threads:
```
"Nice launch! One thing that helped my SaaS was adding screenshot verification - users love proof that the service actually works."
```
```
"Congrats on the launch! Quick tip: adding a free tier or free scan helped my conversion rate a lot. People want to see value before paying."
```

Pricing/Business threads:
```
"I found that being 30-40% cheaper than competitors while offering more features was the sweet spot. Price anchoring against the big players works well."

```

Technical threads:
```
"Next.js + Supabase has been solid for my stack. The auth and database combo saves so much time vs rolling your own."
```
```
"For automation at scale, I'd look into job queues with BullMQ. Handles retries and rate limiting which is critical for API-heavy products."
```

Founder struggles threads:
```
"Been there. The key for me was focusing on one channel until it worked, not spreading thin across 10 platforms. Reddit and SEO were my winners."
```
```
"Customer interviews changed everything. I thought I knew what users wanted but hearing them describe the problem in their own words was eye-opening."
```

Title: Launched GhostMyData - Automated Data Broker Removal

Hey IH! 👋

I built GhostMyData to solve a problem I had - my personal information was on 80+ data broker websites, and removing myself manually would have taken 100+ hours.

What it does:
- Scans 400+ data broker sites
- Automatically submits opt-out requests
- Verifies removals with screenshots
- Monitors for new listings weekly

Stack: Next.js, Prisma, Supabase, Vercel

Would love feedback from the community. What privacy tools do you use?

   - "How do I protect my privacy online?"
   - "Why am I getting so many spam calls?"
   - "How do people find my personal information online?"

**STEP 6: Write Answers (be helpful, not promotional)**

**Answer Template 1 - Data broker removal:**
```
Data brokers collect your information from public records, social media, and purchased data. They sell it to marketers, scammers, and anyone willing to pay.

To remove yourself, you need to submit opt-out requests to each site individually. The major ones are:
- Spokeo
- WhitePages
- BeenVerified
- FastPeopleSearch
- Radaris

Each has a different process. You can do it manually (takes 50-100 hours) or use a service like DeleteMe, Incogni, or GhostMyData to automate it.

The key is also monitoring - these sites often re-list you after a few months.
```

**Answer Template 2 - Spam calls:**
```
Most spam calls originate from data brokers. These companies scrape public records, social media, and other sources to compile profiles with your phone number, then sell that data to telemarketers.

To reduce spam calls:
1. Register on the Do Not Call list (helps with legitimate companies)
2. Remove yourself from data broker sites (the real source)
3. Use call blocking apps
4. Never answer unknown numbers (if you do, you confirm it's active)

The most effective long-term solution is removing yourself from data broker sites. The average person is listed on 80+ of these sites.
```

**Answer Template 3 - Privacy protection:**
```
The best way to protect your privacy online:

1. **Remove yourself from data brokers** - Sites like Spokeo, WhitePages, and BeenVerified have your info. Opt out from each one.

2. **Use unique passwords** - Password manager + unique passwords for every site.

3. **Enable 2FA** - On every account that supports it.

4. **Freeze your credit** - Free with all 3 bureaus, prevents new accounts in your name.

5. **Review app permissions** - Remove access from apps you don't use.

6. **Use a VPN** - Especially on public WiFi.

The data broker removal is often overlooked but it's huge - that's where scammers get your info.

**Sample Response - "What are data brokers?"**
```
Data brokers are companies that collect, aggregate, and sell personal information about individuals. They gather data from public records, social media, purchase histories, and other sources to build detailed profiles including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, relatives, and even income estimates.

The average person's information appears on 80+ data broker websites without their knowledge. This data is then sold to marketers, scammers, debt collectors, and anyone willing to pay - which is why people receive so many spam calls and targeted scams.

At GhostMyData, we help people remove their information from these sites automatically. Manual removal would take 100+ hours due to the sheer number of sites and their varying opt-out processes.
```

**Sample Response - "How to stop spam calls?"**
```
Most spam calls originate from data brokers selling your phone number. While apps and the Do Not Call registry help, they don't address the root cause.

The most effective solution is removing your information from data broker sites like Spokeo, WhitePages, BeenVerified, and the hundreds of others that sell your data. Each site has a different opt-out process, and they often re-add your information after a few months.

Services like GhostMyData automate this process - we submit opt-out requests to 400+ data brokers, verify each removal with screenshots, and monitor weekly for new listings. Our users see significant reductions in spam calls within 2-4 weeks of their data being removed.
