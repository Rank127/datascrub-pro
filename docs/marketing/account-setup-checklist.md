Title: Launched GhostMyData - Automated Data Broker Removal

Hey IH! 👋

I built GhostMyData to solve a problem I had - my personal information was on 80+ data broker websites, and removing myself manually would have taken 100+ hours.

What it does:
- Scans 400+ data broker sites
- Automatically submits opt-out requests
- Verifies removals with screenshots
- Monitors for new listings weekly

Stack: Next.js, Prisma, Supabase, Vercel

Would love feedback from the community. What privacy tools do you use?

### 10. Quora
**URL:** https://www.quora.com/
**Time:** 10 min

**Steps:**
1. Sign up
2. Follow topics: Privacy, Data Privacy, Identity Theft, Cybersecurity
3. Find questions to answer
4. Answer helpfully (not promotional)

**Questions to Find & Answer:**
- "How do I remove my information from data broker sites?"
- "What are data brokers and how do they get my information?"
- "How do I stop spam calls?"
- "Is DeleteMe worth it?"
- "How do I protect my privacy online?"

**Answer Template:**
```
Data brokers collect your information from public records, social media, and purchased data. They sell it to marketers, scammers, and anyone willing to pay.

To remove yourself, you need to submit opt-out requests to each site individually. The major ones are:
- Spokeo
- WhitePages
- BeenVerified
- FastPeopleSearch
- Radaris

Each has a different process. You can do it manually (takes 50-100 hours) or use a service like DeleteMe, Incogni, or GhostMyData to automate it.

The key is also monitoring - these sites often re-list you after a few months.
