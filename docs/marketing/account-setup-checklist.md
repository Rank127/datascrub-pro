7. Click **Save**

**STEP 3: Join Subreddits**
1. Search for each subreddit and click **Join**:
   - r/privacy (main target)
   - r/personalfinance
   - r/technology
   - r/cybersecurity
   - r/LifeProTips
   - r/Scams
   - r/Entrepreneur
   - r/smallbusiness

**STEP 4: Build Karma (DO THIS FOR 2-3 DAYS FIRST)**
1. Browse your joined subreddits
2. Find posts where people ask about privacy, spam calls, data brokers
3. Leave helpful comments (NOT promotional)
4. Upvote good content
5. Build to 50-100 karma before any self-promotion

**Karma Building Comments (copy and adapt):**

For spam call threads:
```
"Data brokers are the source of most spam calls. Look into opting out from sites like Spokeo, WhitePages, and BeenVerified. There are services that automate this if you don't have time to do it manually."
```

For doxxing/privacy threads:
```
"I work in the privacy space - the best defense against doxxing is removing yourself from data broker sites. Most people are on 50+ without knowing it."
```

For "how do I protect my privacy" threads:
```
"Start with the big data brokers: Spokeo, WhitePages, BeenVerified, FastPeopleSearch, Radaris. Each has an opt-out process but they're all different. Takes about 2 hours per site if you do it manually."
```

For identity theft threads:
```
"After a breach, freeze your credit with all 3 bureaus (it's free). Then start opting out of data broker sites - that's how scammers get your info to begin with."
```

**STEP 5: First Post (ONLY after building karma)**
- Wait at least 1 week
- Only post in subreddits that allow self-promotion (check rules!)
- r/SaaS and r/Entrepreneur are more accepting
- Frame as "I built this" not "buy my product"

- [ ] Email verified
- [ ] Profile complete

- [ ] Started karma building (2-3 days minimum)

Hi [Name],

I've been following your hunts - loved [specific product they hunted].

I'm launching GhostMyData, a privacy tool that removes personal data from 400+ data broker sites automatically.

Would you be interested in hunting it? Happy to share early access and provide all assets.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Alternative:** Self-hunt (launch yourself as maker - less visibility but no hunter needed)

**STEP 6: Prepare Maker Comment (for launch day)**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built GhostMyData because I was shocked to find my personal data on 80+ data broker websites. Name, address, phone, relatives - all public and searchable.

Removing myself manually would have taken 100+ hours. So I built a tool to do it automatically.

What GhostMyData does:
🔍 Scans 400+ data broker sites
🗑️ Submits opt-out requests automatically
📸 Verifies each removal with screenshots
📊 Monitors weekly for new listings

We're 40% cheaper than competitors like DeleteMe ($11.99/mo vs $20+).

I'd love your feedback - and happy to answer any questions about privacy, data brokers, or the tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, Puppeteer).

Technical threads:
```
"Next.js + Supabase has been solid for my stack. The auth and database combo saves so much time vs rolling your own."

```

Founder struggles threads:
```
"Been there. The key for me was focusing on one channel until it worked, not spreading thin across 10 platforms. Reddit and SEO were my winners."

I Found My Personal Data on 87 Websites — Here's What I Did About It
```

Story:
```
Last month, I Googled myself. What I found was terrifying.

My full name, home address, phone number, email, age, and even my relatives' names — all publicly listed on websites I'd never heard of. Sites like Spokeo, WhitePages, BeenVerified, and FastPeopleSearch had built detailed profiles about me without my knowledge or consent.

I counted 87 different websites selling my personal information.

## How did this happen?

These sites are called "data brokers." They scrape public records, social media, and purchase data from apps and companies. Then they compile it into searchable profiles and sell access to anyone willing to pay — marketers, scammers, debt collectors, stalkers, or just curious strangers.

This is why you get spam calls. This is why scammers know your name. This is how people get doxxed.

## The manual removal nightmare

I tried removing myself manually. Each site has a different opt-out process:
- Some require email verification
- Some require photo ID uploads
- Some require faxing (yes, faxing)
- Some make you wait 72 hours then resubmit
- Some "process" your request and never actually remove you

After spending 6 hours removing myself from just 12 sites, I did the math. At 30 minutes per site, removing myself from all 87 would take over 40 hours.

And here's the worst part — they re-add you after a few months.

## The real cost of exposed data

This isn't just an inconvenience. Exposed personal data leads to:

- **Spam calls** — Telemarketers buy your number from data brokers
- **Identity theft** — Criminals use your info to open accounts in your name
- **Stalking** — Abusers use people-search sites to find victims
- **Targeted scams** — Scammers use your details to make calls more convincing
- **Employment issues** — Background checks pull from these sites

## What actually works

After researching solutions, I found three options:

1. **Manual removal** — Free, but takes 50–100 hours and requires constant monitoring
2. **Paid services** — Companies like DeleteMe ($129/year) or Incogni ($77/year) automate the process
3. **Build your own tool** — What I ended up doing

I built GhostMyData because I was frustrated with the options. It scans 400+ data broker sites, submits opt-out requests automatically, verifies each removal with screenshots, and monitors weekly for new listings.

## 5 things you can do right now

Even if you don't use a removal service, here's how to protect yourself:

1. **Google yourself** — See what's out there (use incognito mode)
2. **Start with the big ones** — Opt out from Spokeo, WhitePages, and BeenVerified first
3. **Freeze your credit** — Free with all 3 bureaus, prevents identity theft
4. **Use unique passwords** — Get a password manager
5. **Set a calendar reminder** — Re-check these sites every 3 months

## The bottom line

Your personal data is a commodity being bought and sold without your permission. The data broker industry generates $250 billion annually by trading information about people like you.

You can fight back, but it takes effort. Whether you do it manually, use a service, or build your own solution — the important thing is to start.

Your privacy is worth protecting.

   - "How do I protect my privacy online?"
   - "Why am I getting so many spam calls?"
   - "How do people find my personal information online?"

**STEP 6: Write Answers (be helpful, not promotional)**

**Answer Template 1 - Data broker removal:**
```
Data brokers collect your information from public records, social media, and purchased data. They sell it to marketers, scammers, and anyone willing to pay.

To remove yourself, you need to submit opt-out requests to each site individually. The major ones are:
- Spokeo
- WhitePages
- BeenVerified
- FastPeopleSearch
- Radaris

Each has a different process. You can do it manually (takes 50-100 hours) or use a service like DeleteMe, Incogni, or GhostMyData to automate it.

The key is also monitoring - these sites often re-list you after a few months.
```

**Answer Template 2 - Spam calls:**
```
Most spam calls originate from data brokers. These companies scrape public records, social media, and other sources to compile profiles with your phone number, then sell that data to telemarketers.

To reduce spam calls:
1. Register on the Do Not Call list (helps with legitimate companies)
2. Remove yourself from data broker sites (the real source)
3. Use call blocking apps
4. Never answer unknown numbers (if you do, you confirm it's active)

The most effective long-term solution is removing yourself from data broker sites. The average person is listed on 80+ of these sites.
```

**Answer Template 3 - Privacy protection:**
```
The best way to protect your privacy online:

1. **Remove yourself from data brokers** - Sites like Spokeo, WhitePages, and BeenVerified have your info. Opt out from each one.

2. **Use unique passwords** - Password manager + unique passwords for every site.

3. **Enable 2FA** - On every account that supports it.

4. **Freeze your credit** - Free with all 3 bureaus, prevents new accounts in your name.

5. **Review app permissions** - Remove access from apps you don't use.

6. **Use a VPN** - Especially on public WiFi.

The data broker removal is often overlooked but it's huge - that's where scammers get your info.

Subject: Re: [Query Title] - [Your Name], Privacy Expert

Hi [Reporter Name],

I'm [Your Name], Founder of GhostMyData, a privacy protection service that removes personal data from 400+ data broker websites.

[Answer their specific question with 2-3 paragraphs]

Key points:
• [Point 1]
• [Point 2]

I'd be happy to provide additional insights or data if helpful for your piece.

**Sample Response - "What are data brokers?"**
```
Data brokers are companies that collect, aggregate, and sell personal information about individuals. They gather data from public records, social media, purchase histories, and other sources to build detailed profiles including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, relatives, and even income estimates.

The average person's information appears on 80+ data broker websites without their knowledge. This data is then sold to marketers, scammers, debt collectors, and anyone willing to pay - which is why people receive so many spam calls and targeted scams.

At GhostMyData, we help people remove their information from these sites automatically. Manual removal would take 100+ hours due to the sheer number of sites and their varying opt-out processes.
```

**Sample Response - "How to stop spam calls?"**
```
Most spam calls originate from data brokers selling your phone number. While apps and the Do Not Call registry help, they don't address the root cause.

The most effective solution is removing your information from data broker sites like Spokeo, WhitePages, BeenVerified, and the hundreds of others that sell your data. Each site has a different opt-out process, and they often re-add your information after a few months.

Services like GhostMyData automate this process - we submit opt-out requests to 400+ data brokers, verify each removal with screenshots, and monitor weekly for new listings. Our users see significant reductions in spam calls within 2-4 weeks of their data being removed.
```

**Tips for Success:**
- Respond within 2-4 hours (reporters have deadlines)
- Be concise but thorough
- Include your credentials
- Offer additional help
- Don't be overly promotional
- Follow up if you don't hear back
