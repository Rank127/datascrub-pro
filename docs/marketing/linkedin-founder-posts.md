# LinkedIn Founder Posts for GhostMyData

## Post 1: Origin Story (Best for first post)

```
I Googled myself last year.

What I found was terrifying.

My home address. My phone number. My age. My relatives' names. Even an estimate of my income.

All public. All searchable. All on dozens of websites I'd never heard of.

Anyone could find where I live in 30 seconds.

I spent 60+ hours manually removing myself from these "data broker" sites. Each one had a different process. Some required faxing. In 2024.

That's when I decided to build GhostMyData.

We now automatically remove people from 400+ data broker sites. No forms. No faxing. No 60-hour weekends.

If you've never Googled yourself, do it now. You might be surprised what strangers can find.

And if you don't like what you see, we can help.

## Post 2: Problem Awareness

```
Your personal data is being sold right now.

Not by hackers. Not illegally.

By companies called "data brokers."

They collect your information from:
→ Public records
→ Social media
→ Loyalty programs
→ Other data companies

Then they sell it to:
→ Telemarketers (why you get spam calls)
→ Scammers (why they know your name)
→ Anyone with a credit card

The average person is on 80+ of these sites.

The industry is worth $200 billion.

And most people have no idea it exists.

I'm building GhostMyData to fight back.

Google yourself. See what's out there.

## Post 3: Customer Win Story

```
Got a message from a user yesterday that made my week:

"I was being stalked. He found my new address through one of these people search sites. After GhostMyData removed my info, he couldn't find me anymore. Thank you."

This is why I built this company.

Not for the business metrics.
Not for the revenue.

For moments like this.

Privacy isn't a luxury. For some people, it's survival.

We've removed 50,000+ data broker listings so far.

Every single one matters to someone.

## Post 4: Industry Insight

```
Unpopular opinion: Data brokers aren't evil.

They're just playing by rules that shouldn't exist.

Here's how the system works:

1. Public records are... public (by law)
2. Companies can aggregate public data (legal)
3. They can sell aggregated data (legal)
4. You have to opt-out site by site (by design)

The game is rigged against consumers.

CCPA and GDPR helped, but enforcement is weak.

Until the laws change, the best defense is opting out.

That's why I built GhostMyData - to automate what the law makes tedious.

Should data brokers be regulated more strictly?

I'd love to hear your thoughts 👇

## Post 5: Behind the Scenes / Building in Public

```
Building a startup is humbling.

This week at GhostMyData:

✅ Shipped SMS notifications for Enterprise users
✅ Added 23 new data broker sites to our coverage
❌ Broke production at 2am (fixed by 2:47am)
❌ Got rejected by 2 potential partners

The wins feel great.
The losses teach more.

3 months ago, I was removing data brokers manually.
Now we've automated 400+ sites.

Still a long way to go.

If you're building something too, keep going. The compounding is real.

## Post 6: Contrarian Take

```
Hot take: "I have nothing to hide" is the most dangerous phrase in privacy.

Here's why:

You might have nothing to hide.
But you have plenty to protect.

→ Your home address (from stalkers)
→ Your phone number (from scammers)
→ Your relatives' info (from social engineers)
→ Your income estimate (from targeted fraud)

Privacy isn't about hiding.
It's about controlling who knows what about you.

Would you give a stranger on the street your home address?

Then why is it okay for data brokers to give it to millions of strangers online?

## Post 7: Milestone / Traction

```
50,000 data broker listings removed. 🎉

When I started GhostMyData, I wondered if anyone would care.

Turns out, a lot of people care:
- Parents protecting their families
- Executives avoiding social engineering
- Survivors escaping dangerous situations
- Regular people tired of spam calls

Every removal is someone's peace of mind.

Thank you to everyone who trusted us with your privacy.

Next milestone: 100,000.

## Post 8: Educational / How-To

```
How to check your data broker exposure in 60 seconds:

1. Open Google
2. Search: "Your Name" + "Your City"
3. Look for results from:
   - Spokeo
   - WhitePages
   - BeenVerified
   - FastPeopleSearch
   - TruePeopleSearch

4. Click through. See what's exposed.

Shocked? Most people are.

The average person appears on 80+ of these sites.

You can remove yourself manually (takes 100+ hours) or use a service to automate it.

Either way, start by knowing what's out there.

Knowledge is the first step to protection.

## Post 9: Failure / Learning Story

```
I almost gave up on GhostMyData last month.

Here's what happened:

A data broker changed their opt-out process overnight. Our automation broke. 2,000 pending removals failed.

I spent 72 hours rebuilding the integration.

Then another site changed. And another.

That's when I realized: this is the job.

Data brokers don't want to make opt-outs easy. They change processes constantly. They add CAPTCHAs. They require phone verification.

Every obstacle is a feature, not a bug.

Our job is to keep up. To adapt. To make privacy accessible despite the friction.

Some days that's exhausting.

Most days it's motivating.

The harder they make it, the more people need us.

Quick poll for my network:

Have you ever Googled yourself to see what data brokers have on you?

🔍 Yes, and I was shocked
😅 Yes, but it wasn't that bad
🙈 No, I'm afraid to look
❓ What's a data broker?

## Tips for LinkedIn

1. **Post 2-3x per week** (not daily - quality over quantity)
2. **First line is everything** - make it hook
3. **Use line breaks** - walls of text don't work
4. **End with a question** - drives comments
5. **Reply to every comment** - within 1 hour if possible
6. **Best times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 5-6pm
7. **Add hashtags** at the end (3-5 max)
8. **Tag relevant people** sparingly (only if they'd genuinely care)
