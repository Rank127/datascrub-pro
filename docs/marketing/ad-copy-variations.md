## BODY COPY VARIATIONS

### Short (Under 50 words)

**Version A:**
Data brokers collect and sell your personal information to anyone. Your name, address, phone, and more - all public. GhostMyData removes you from 2,100+ data broker sites automatically. Free scan shows exactly where you're exposed.

**Version B:**
Your home address is on dozens of websites right now. Stalkers, scammers, and telemarketers can find you in seconds. We remove your data from 2,100+ sites and monitor for new exposures weekly.

**Version C:**
Tired of spam calls? Data brokers sell your phone number. We remove it from the source - 2,100+ data broker websites. One service. Automatic removal. Continuous protection.

### Medium (50-100 words)

**Version A:**
Right now, your personal information is listed on an average of 80+ data broker websites. Your name, address, phone number, age, relatives, and more - all available to anyone who searches.

Data brokers profit billions selling your data. GhostMyData fights back.

We scan 2,100+ data broker sites, find your exposed information, and automatically submit removal requests. Then we monitor weekly to catch new listings.

Free scan shows exactly where you're exposed. See for yourself.

**Version B:**
Why do strangers keep calling you? Data brokers.

These companies scrape public records, aggregate your information, and sell it to telemarketers, scammers, and anyone willing to pay.

GhostMyData removes your data from 2,100+ of these sites automatically. No forms to fill out. No hours of research. We handle the entire opt-out process for you.

Start with a free scan. See how exposed you really are.

### Long (100-150 words)

**Version A:**
The average person appears on 80+ data broker websites. These sites display your home address, phone number, email, age, relatives, and more - all publicly searchable.

This information fuels spam calls, enables stalking, and provides identity thieves with everything they need to impersonate you.

Removing yourself manually takes 100+ hours. Each site has different opt-out procedures, many deliberately confusing. And even after you remove yourself, they often re-list you within months.

GhostMyData solves this permanently.

We scan 2,100+ data broker sites to find your exposed information. We automatically submit removal requests on your behalf. We verify each removal with screenshots. And we monitor weekly to catch new listings before they spread.

Plans start at $11.99/month - 40% less than competitors like DeleteMe and Incogni.

Take back your privacy. Start with a free scan.
