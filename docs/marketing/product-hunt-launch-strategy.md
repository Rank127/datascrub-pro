### Prepare Assets

3. Before/after removal comparison
4. Feature highlights (infographic style)
5. Pricing comparison vs competitors

### Craft Copy

**Tagline (60 chars max):**

Remove your personal data from 2,100+ sites automatically
```

**Description (260 chars):**
```
Data brokers sell your personal information to anyone. GhostMyData scans 2,100+ data broker sites, finds your exposed data, automatically submits removal requests, verifies each removal, and monitors weekly. Take back your privacy with a free scan.
```

**Full Description (for "About" section):**
```
## The Problem

Right now, your personal information is listed on an average of 80+ data broker websites. Your name, address, phone number, age, relatives, income estimates - all publicly searchable and for sale.

These sites fuel:
- Spam calls and texts
- Stalking and harassment
- Identity theft
- Targeted scams

Removing yourself manually takes 100+ hours. Each site has different opt-out procedures, many deliberately confusing.

## The Solution

GhostMyData automates the entire process:

🔍 **Scan** - We check 2,100+ data broker sites for your information
📋 **Find** - See exactly where you're exposed with detailed reports
🗑️ **Remove** - We automatically submit opt-out requests on your behalf
✅ **Verify** - Every removal is verified with screenshot proof
📊 **Monitor** - Weekly scans catch new listings before they spread

## Why GhostMyData?

- **More coverage**: 2,100+ data sources across 92 categories (vs 200-1,000 for competitors)
- **Better pricing**: Starting at $11.99/mo (40% less than alternatives)
- **AI-powered**: 24 AI agents for scanning, removal, and monitoring
- **AI Shield**: 60 sources covering facial recognition, voice cloning, and deepfakes
- **Dark web monitoring**: 365 sources + breach database integration (HIBP + LeakCheck)
- **Family plans**: Protect up to 5 family members (Enterprise)

## Get Started

Start with a free scan to see exactly where your data is exposed. No credit card required.

## Maker's First Comment (Post Immediately)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], founder of GhostMyData. Here's why I built this:

Last year, I Googled myself and found my home address, phone number, relatives' names, and estimated income on dozens of websites. Anyone could find this in seconds.

I spent 60+ hours manually opting out from data broker sites. Each one had a different process. Some required faxing (!). Some re-listed me within months.

I thought: there has to be a better way.

So I built GhostMyData to automate the entire process:
- Scan 2,100+ data broker sites
- Auto-submit opt-out requests
- Verify removals with screenshots
- Monitor for new listings weekly

We've already removed 50,000+ data broker listings for our users.

**Special for PH:**
Use code PRODUCTHUNT for 30% off your first 3 months.

I'll be here all day answering questions. Would love your feedback!

What's the craziest thing you've found when Googling yourself? 👇

🚀 We just launched on @ProductHunt!

GhostMyData removes your personal data from 2,100+ data broker websites automatically.

Here's why this matters: 🧵

1/ Your personal information is for sale right now.

Data brokers collect your name, address, phone, relatives, income estimates, and more. Anyone can find this with a simple Google search.

2/ This fuels:
- Spam calls (they know your number)
- Stalking (they know your address)
- Identity theft (they know everything)
- Targeted scams (they know your family)

3/ Removing yourself manually takes 100+ hours.

Each site has different opt-out procedures. Some require mail. Some re-list you within months. It's a full-time job.

4/ GhostMyData automates everything:

🔍 Scan 2,100+ data broker sites
📋 Find where you're exposed
🗑️ Auto-submit removal requests
✅ Verify with screenshot proof
📊 Monitor weekly for new listings

5/ We're 40% cheaper than competitors like DeleteMe and Incogni, with more coverage and better verification.

Start with a free scan to see your exposure.

### LinkedIn Post
```
🚀 Exciting news: GhostMyData just launched on Product Hunt!

I built this because of a personal experience - finding my home address, phone number, and family members' names on dozens of data broker websites.

These sites sell your personal information to anyone willing to pay. The result? Spam calls, stalking, identity theft.

GhostMyData fights back by:
✓ Scanning 2,100+ data broker sites
✓ Automatically submitting removal requests
✓ Verifying each removal with screenshots
✓ Monitoring weekly for new listings

We've already helped users remove 50,000+ data broker listings.

Would really appreciate your support on Product Hunt today: [LINK]

And if you know anyone concerned about their online privacy, please share!

## Answering Common Questions

**Q: How is this different from DeleteMe?**
```
Great question! A few key differences:
1. Coverage: We scan 2,100+ sources across 92 categories vs their ~750
2. Price: $11.99/mo vs their ~$10/mo, but we include dark web monitoring and AI Shield
3. AI-Powered: 24 AI agents handle scanning, removal, and monitoring automatically
4. AI Shield: We protect against facial recognition, voice cloning, and deepfake threats
5. Family Plans: Protect up to 5 family members on our Enterprise plan
6. Breach Monitoring: Integrated HIBP + LeakCheck (most competitors don't include this)
```

**Q: How do you actually remove the data?**
```
Each data broker has an opt-out process (legally required under CCPA, GDPR, etc.). We've mapped out the process for 2,100+ sites and automated the submission. Some require email verification, which we handle. Some require waiting periods. We track all of this and verify removal after the expected timeframe.
```

**Q: Does this really work?**
```
Yes! We verify every removal with screenshots. The average user has data on 80+ sites, and we remove from all of them. We also monitor weekly because these sites often re-list people. When that happens, we remove again automatically.
```

**Q: Is my data safe with you?**
```
Absolutely. We only collect what's needed to find your information on data broker sites. All data is encrypted, we never sell or share it, and you can delete your account (and all associated data) anytime. We're the opposite of data brokers.
