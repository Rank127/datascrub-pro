# Mastermind Meetings Archive

Strategic meeting notes from the GhostMyData Mastermind Advisory System.

## Meeting Types

### Board Meetings (`board-meetings/`)
Full Nucleus deliberation with all 5 Architects (Huang, Hassabis, Buffett, Nadella, Amodei) using the 7-step decision protocol: MAP → ANALYZE → DESIGN → SAFETY CHECK → BUILD & SHIP → SELL → GOVERN.

### Cabinet Meetings (`cabinet-meetings/`)
Focused deliberations with Mission Team leads and domain-specific advisors. Narrower scope than board meetings — typically one domain or initiative.

## Naming Convention
`YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` (e.g., `2026-02-13-codebase-state-review.md`)
