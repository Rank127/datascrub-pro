# Bootstrap Marketing Plan: $500 Budget

## The Reality Check

With $500, paid advertising is essentially off the table. You'll get maybe 20-50 customers from ads. Instead, we focus on **high-leverage, zero-cost tactics** that can scale.

**Aggressive MRR Target: $15,000-25,000/month by end of year**
**Customers Needed: 750-1,250 (at $20 ARPU)**

## Budget Allocation

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Domain/Tools | $100 | Landing page tools, email warmup |
| Micro-Influencers | $200 | 4-5 small creators ($40-50 each) |
| Reddit/Twitter Ads | $100 | Retargeting only |
| Giveaway/Contest | $100 | Prize for viral campaign |
| **TOTAL** | **$500** | |

## Conclusion

With $500 and relentless execution, you can realistically achieve:

- **Conservative:** $15,000 MRR (750 customers)
- **Moderate:** $20,000 MRR (1,000 customers)
- **Aggressive:** $28,000 MRR (1,400 customers)

The key difference from a funded startup: **TIME instead of MONEY**.

You're trading 40+ hours/week of hustle for 12 months instead of $1.7M in ad spend.

If you can maintain the consistency, the organic foundation you build will be MORE valuable long-term because:
1. Zero CAC on organic customers
2. Higher LTV (organic users are more engaged)
3. Sustainable growth (not dependent on ad spend)
4. Community/brand moat

**Start today. Post tomorrow. $25K MRR in 12 months is achievable.**
