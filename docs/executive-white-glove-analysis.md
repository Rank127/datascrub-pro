## Open Questions

1. **US vs Offshore:** Should we emphasize "US-based analysts" like Privacy Bee, or optimize for margin with offshore team?

2. **SLA Commitments:** What response times can we guarantee?
   - Initial removal request: 24-48 hours?
   - Emergency situations: 1-4 hours?

3. **Family Definition:** How do we define "family"?
   - Immediate family only (spouse + children)?
   - Include parents, siblings?
   - Domestic partners, ex-spouses with shared custody?

4. **Proof of Relationship:** Do we require documentation for family members?

5. **Contract Terms:** Annual commitment required, or month-to-month available?

6. **Onboarding:** How much executive time is needed for initial setup?

**Start with Option C (Simplified Premium Tiers):**

| Plan | Price | Target |

| EXECUTIVE COMPLETE | $499/mo | Public figures, high-net-worth |

1. Simple to explain and sell
2. Good margins (34-50%) with offshore labor
3. Competitive with market ($2,388-5,988/yr vs $199-799/yr competitors)
4. Justified by family coverage and AI Shield differentiator
