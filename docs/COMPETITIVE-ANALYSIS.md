|--------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Data brokers covered | 8 (mock) | 150 (real) | 400 (real) |

## Conclusion

GhostMyData has a solid foundation with competitive pricing, unique features (DNC Registry, RBAC, breach monitoring), and a modern tech stack. However, **the critical gap is the lack of real data broker integrations**. Without this core functionality, the service cannot compete on the primary value proposition of the market.

**Immediate priorities:**
1. Replace mock scanners with real data broker integrations
2. Implement automated removal submission
3. Expand broker coverage to 100+ within 3 months

**Long-term differentiation:**
- Lean into unique features competitors don't have (DNC, RBAC, breach monitoring)
- Build the mobile app advantage
- Consider identity theft insurance partnership

The market is growing rapidly (26M users expected in 2026), and there's room for a well-executed competitor that combines competitive pricing with comprehensive coverage and unique features.
