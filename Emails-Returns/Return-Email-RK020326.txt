Rakesh,

Thank you for your email requesting removal of your personal data from Common Crawl’s archive and the addition of your domain and likeness to Common Crawl’s opt-out registry.  From the little information you have provided, we do not believe the GDPR or CCPA requires Common Crawl to remove any web crawl data it has collected and archived.  Nevertheless, as a courtesy, if you provide us with the exact location where your personal data is located, Common Crawl will include the URL in the opt-out registry.

Hello,
 
We have received a data erasure request submitted on your behalf via GhostMyData (https://ghostmydata.com/).
 
Unfortunately, we are unable to process this request for the following reasons:
 
FaceApp does not use email-based accounts or require user registration. As a result, we cannot locate, identify, or verify any user data based solely on an email address. It remains unclear how GhostMyData generated this request, as we have no means of identifying FaceApp users by email.
 
How to submit a valid erasure request:
 
If you wish to exercise your right to erasure, please use the Send Privacy Request feature within the FaceApp application. This is the only method that allows us to verify your identity as the data subject and process your request accordingly.
 
We have also contacted GhostMyData regarding the submission of such requests through their platform.
 
Kind regards,
